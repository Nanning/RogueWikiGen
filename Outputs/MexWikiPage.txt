'''Mechs/IS-A'''

==Description==

The Amazon battle armor was created by the Magistracy of Canopus. Based on the standard Inner Sphere battle armor, the Amazon uses advanced armor to increase protection and provides a jump capability of 90 meters. This allows Amazon-equipped troops to clear obstacles that would stop other battle armor units. The Amazon is used by both the Magistracy and the Capellan Confederation. Amazons deployed by the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces faced Cavalier battle armor and turned in a better performance.

'''Mechs/TOAD'''

==Description==

The standard against which all battle armor is measured, the Elemental battle armor was first introduced in 2868 by Clan Wolf in a Trial of Possession against the Nova Cats. It was a marvel of Clan engineering that allowed a small group of operators to take down large 'Mechs and survive the encounter. While it is possible for a normal-sized human to use the battle armor, this design is tailored for the Clans' giant Elemental warriors and only they can bring out its fullest potential.

==Description==

The Salamander the design incorporates fire-based weapons; its primary armaments being a pair of Flamers slung under the arms and a single, one-shot short-range missile strapped to the shoulder, invariably one with an Inferno payload. This makes the Salamander especially potent against infantry and combat vehicles, though that does not mean it is less intimidating to MechWarriors: few would want to get caught in the sights of a Salamander Point.

The Fa Shih duplicates many of the features of the Inner Sphere Standard battle armor, including its jump capacity and most of the weaponry used. However the suit went against battle armor philosophy at the time by emphasizing defensive capabilities as much as offensive.

==Description==

The Inner Sphere Standard was developed following the initial thrust of the Clan invasion, as Inner Sphere powers rushed to duplicate the battle armor technology the Clans fielded. Lacking any battlefield salvage on which to base their development though, engineers were forced to work off of ancient rumors of early power armor suits like the Nighthawk, more akin to armored Exoskeletons than the 'Toads' currently rampaging through known space, and these prototypes fared poorly during testing. It took salvage from the first victories over the Clans to truly kick-start the development of battle armor. The New Avalon Institute of Science was the first to reproduce in part the Clans' Elemental armor as the Inner Sphere Standard.

==Description==

A rather unique ProtoMech that once belonged to a skilled Pirate leader, clad in and repaired with so much scrap and mismatched parts that it's impossible to tell what the base chassis ever was, or if it even had one. Fast and clearly designed with close combat in mind, this scrap bucket comes armed with a specialized Chainsaw and a unique, sawn-off twin-barreled pirate ProtoMech-sized shotgun. It's ramshackle nature makes it hard to gather exact specifications, but one thing's for sure; this thing will prove to be a real beast in close quarters.

A stark departure from the standard design doctrine of the Sprite, the 3 mounts a pair of the new Fusillade launcher systems, backed by a pair of Medium Chemical Lasers. While limited in it’s main punch and entirely dependent on ammunition, the sheer versatility in available munition types for the Fusillade system allow it a great degree of battlefield versatility, from dealing heavy direct damage to disabling and overheating hostile vehicles and BattleMechs.

'''Mechs/SPT/15-2'''

==Description==

Taking something of an alternate approach to the same battlefield niche, the Sprite 2 trades it’s quartet of LRM launchers for a single ‘Mech-scale ERLL. While it lacks the raw offensive power of the 1, it is able to deal highly concentrated damage, and turns the Sprite into a mobile, hardy, and lethal sniping platform. Both patterns operate with great synergy, the 2 punching holes in armor for the 1’s launchers to exploit, much to the chagrin of forces facing the Society in combat.

'''Mechs/SPT/15'''

==Description==

Debuting in 3072, the Sprite SPT/15 is one of the Society’s premier frontline ‘Superheavy’ ProtoMechs. Designed as a highly survivable, highly mobile fire support unit, the Sprite mates four LRM5 launchers to a rugged chassis fitted with five Extended Jump Jets and 3.25 tons of armor, over 20% of the unit’s mass. While not the most mobile unit on the ground, and a little light on ammunition, grouped Sprite formations have proved to be a lethal and stubborn foe to dislodge time and time again.

==Description==

This mech was salvaged in the later stages of the wars against the clans by a innately lucky mercenary who maanged to pilfer it without his employers catching wind of his new found mech. He promptly emblazoned a Large orange Corgi, a terran creature on the side of the mech and fashioned on as many of his horded parts as the poor mech engineers could jury rg on to the frame to create this monstrosity with no thought for if they SHOULD do it.

'''Mechs/ADR-PRIME'''

==Description==

Codenamed Puma by Inner Sphere forces who first engaged it, the Adder is a light Clan OmniMech that serves as a direct or an indirect fire-support unit in most of its configurations. The Primary configuration has a basic but powerful arsenal of two ER PPCs which are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer, allowing the Primary configuration of the Adder to strike at long range with deadly accuracy. It also sports a flamer.

'''Mechs/ADR-D'''

==Description==

Sticking to the general theme for this rather slow 35 tonner, the Adder-D fields a mid to long range setup in form of an ER Large Laser and an Ultra Autocannon/5. The ADR-D will try to keep its distance and open up components from a safe distance before it moves in to finish the job with a set of Streak SRM2s.

'''Mechs/ADR-C'''

==Description==

As a slightly lighter armed long range bombardment variant, the Adder-C 'only' sports two LRM-15 launchers as the main armament... And also an additional launcher for a NARC Homing Beacons. You can't hide anywhere if you have one of those stuck on your hull. For CQC and as a non ammo-dependent backup weapon, a single Medium Pulse Laser can absolutely ruin the day for ambushers who think the LRM support mech might be an easy kill.

'''Mechs/ADR-B'''

==Description==

Every time the Adder-B is spotted you can't stop wondering how the clans fit all that firepower on a tiny 35 ton chassis. With an extremely accurate Large Pulse Laser this mid to long range configuration softens up the armor of an enemy to finish it at medium range with its powerful LB-X AC/5, backed up by a pair of ERMLs. Never underestimate the power of an ADR-B, it might be a mistake you can't recover from.

==Description==

For a mech of just 35 tons this little turtle sports a lot of long range fire support in the form of 40 LRM tubes, which can scare away even much much larger enemies. For close range, self defense or a last effort push if the ammo bins are empty, the ADR-A carries 2 Small Pulse Lasers and the standard Flamer.

'''Mechs/ARB-001'''

==Description==

Built by Meridian Manufacturing, the Arbiter is nothing more than a light WorkMech crafted to look like a large and impressive Heavy Battlemech. Despite its unremarkable nature, Meridian has been extremely successful in selling the design in battalion sized lots with a six-month back order. The reason for this is their keen understanding of pirate psychology. Despite its thin armor and limited weaponry, the Arbiter is an intimidating sight that will quickly encourage most pirates to find an easier looking target.

'''Mechs/AF1F'''

==Description==

The Arctic Fox is a light OmniMech reverse engineered by the Kell Hounds from the Clan Uller OmniMech with assistance in the final stages from Clan Wolf-in-Exile. The resulting OmniMech is a powerful light 'Mech that has a top speed of 97.2 km/h that is provided by a GM 180 XL engine, shaving off valuable weight from the Arctic Fox's base chassis while also making the 'Mech vulnerable to becoming a combat kill through the loss of one of its side torsos. The Arctic Fox has ten double heat sinks which are generally enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load, with the ability to add more if needed. To protect itself from enemy fire, the Arctic Fox has six tons of Royal-7 armor.

'''Mechs/AF1'''

==Description==

The Arctic Fox is a light OmniMech reverse engineered by the Kell Hounds from the Clan Uller OmniMech with assistance in the final stages from Clan Wolf-in-Exile. The resulting OmniMech is a powerful light 'Mech that has a top speed of 97.2 km/h that is provided by a GM 180 XL engine, shaving off valuable weight from the Arctic Fox's base chassis while also making the 'Mech vulnerable to becoming a combat kill through the loss of one of its side torsos. The Arctic Fox has ten double heat sinks which are generally enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load, with the ability to add more if needed. To protect itself from enemy fire, the Arctic Fox has six tons of Royal-7 armor.

'''Mechs/BH-K306'''

==Description==

The Battle Hawk was originally designed and built at a time when Defiance Industries felt threatened by the large amount of equipment being produced by, and imported from, the Free Worlds League. It was built to prove that Defiance Industries was still an industry leader in BattleMechs. This came from a 'Mech that, while slow for its weight class, is a force to be reckoned with on the modern battlefield. The Battle Hawk has a top speed of 86.4 kph, which puts it on par with 'Mechs fifteen to twenty tons heavier than itself, but it also carries a powerful arsenal for its size. Its five and a half tons of armor give it good protection for a light 'Mech. Additionally, to make the Battle Hawk more maneuverable on the battlefield, it can jump up to one hundred and fifty meters.

'''Mechs/CPH-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Cephalus was developed by The Society as an escort unit for their Septicemia series OmniMech. This light 'Mech was designed to carry the Nova Combined Electronic Warfare System (CEWS) onto the battlefield. To insure that the Cephalus would survive, the designers used a 250-rated XXL Engine  alongside a Chameleon Light Polarisation Shield. As its role is limited to electronic targeting support and occasional reconnaissance, the Cephalus wasn't often equipped with weaponry. The primary configuration of the Cephalus carried twin Laser AMS systems, one in each side torso. To further protect the 'Mech, it mounted three Modular Armor units on the front torsos.

'''Mechs/COM-7S2'''

==Description==

The personal 'Mech of ex-Arcturan Guards member-turned-treacherous Hunter's Paradise guide Zvi Freyr, his Commando has been extensively modified with both Clan and experimental technologies. Retaining only the Endo Steel chassis and CASE of his formerly stock COM-5S model, Freyr has replaced the standard weapons with lighter Clan-tech systems, including two Streak SRM-4 launchers in its right arm with a single ton of reloads and a pair of ER Medium Lasers mounted in the left arm. The use of a Small Cockpit and a salvaged Clan extra-light engine save enough weight to switch to double strength heat sinks, as well as carry five jump jets and seven tons of Hardened Armor.

==Description==

In 3055 the Taurian Concordat's Vandenburg Mechanized Industries produced limited runs of this factory refit of the Commando COM-2D using stealth and sensor packages imported from the Cappelan Confederation. While the result was an effective scout, with respectable ambush capabilities, the expense compared to the base model, and the difficulties of multinational production, kept it from widespread adoption.

'''Mechs/COM-TDK'''

==Description==

A unique Commando piloted by Captain Bono Duganmare of the 22nd Skye Rangers, the "Death's Knell"; is refitted with recovered LosTech. Swapping the standard SRM racks for an additional 3 Medium lasers, allows the TDK’s engine to be refitted with a 175 core. The inclusion of DHS keeps the mech comfortably cool. An extra half ton of armour round out the design.

A post Jihad redesign, the Commando 8S uses an Endo Steel chassis and XL Engine. A pair of Streak SRM-2 launchers are carried in the right arm with a pair of ER Medium Lasers in the left arm. The Streak ammunition is stored in a CASE II protected bay. A Boosted C3 Slave allows the Commando to share targeting data with friendly forces, and a Supercharger allows it to reach speeds of 140km/h in short bursts.

'''Mechs/COM-7B'''

==Description==

Following the conquest of Coventry by the Word of Blake, the Jihadists modified the 7S to meet their specifications. The 7B keeps one ER Medium Laser in the left arm, but adds two Flamers to it, making the 7B a lethal threat to unarmored infantry. A small cockpit makes room for two SRM-4s, which are still fed by a CASE-protected ammunition bin. The weight savings enabled engineers to add enough jump jets to rocket the Commando up to one hundred-twenty meters at a time. They also added an additional ton of armor.

==Description==

The COM-5S was introduced in 3050 and was the first Commando to feature Star League technology. Its new Cyclops MultiTasker 10 Targeting System links an Artemis IV Fire Control System to the Coventry 90 mm SRM-6, which replaces the Shannon Six-Shooter, and exchanges the SRM-4 with a Coventry T4H Streak SRM-2 launcher. Additionally, the chassis has been upgraded with Endo Steel, the armor has been upgraded to Ferro-Fibrous, and CASE has been added to protect the ammunition.

'''Mechs/COM-3A'''

==Description==

A very recent variant, the 3A mounts a pair of SRM-6 racks and supplements its close in firepower with a Flamer.  It is an excellent quick strike 'Mech, but suffers in drawn out fights due to a limited supply of ammunition for the SRMs.

'''Mechs/COM-IIC'''

==Description==

During the Amaris Civil War, several Lyran MechWarriors joined the SLDF in defiance of their government's policy of neutrality. With this came the coup that the Star League Defense Force had attempted to pull off for decades: the acquisition of the Lyran Commando. Long considered one of the better scout 'Mechs in the Inner Sphere, at least one of these Commandos accompanied Kerensky into exile and several of them appeared in the forces assigned to Operation Klondike. As newer weapons and 'Mechs made their way into the Clan arsenal, these Commandos began to show their age, so Clan Goliath Scorpion began a program to upgrade theirs. Dubbed the Commando IIC, this upgrade used newer technologies to outperform its venerable cousin. With the proliferation of OmniMechs, most Commando IICs were relegated to second line status, though the Scorpions still continue to outfit some of their pirate hunters with these 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/CPR-HD-004'''

==Description==

First produced in late fall of 3054, the Copperhead is a finely honed arena 'Mech. The design rose to fame when Silver Dragons Stables MechWarrior Brendon Frazer piloted his Copperhead, the Silver Snake, into the Solaris Top Twenty prior to his untimely death. The Silver Dragons commissioned Solaris Arms to develop a new exclusive variant to try and repeat the feat, but the new model's expensive experimental weaponry forced them to allow sales to other interested parties. The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery snapped up a number of the original CPR-HD-002 models. While not increasing the original model's meager four and half tons of armor coverage, Solaris Arms chose to replace the original Durallex plating with ArcShield Reflective Armor to enhance its endurance against the large volume of energy weapons carried by Arena 'Mechs. Already a relatively speedy design, the addition of a Supercharger enhanced its ground speed. Its extremely short jumping distance was neither improved nor removed; instead it was retained to expand a pilot's options in tight terrain. An extra Double Heat Sink, bringing the total to thirteen, is still not enough to keep up with the increased heat produced by the CPR-HD-003's advanced laser weaponry. Allowing the designers to squeeze in the new systems, a cramped Small Cockpit is used, which is less of a liability in the short duration arena battles than on an actual battlefield.

'''Mechs/CPR-HD-002'''

==Description==

First produced in late fall of 3054, the Copperhead is a finely honed arena 'Mech. The design rose to fame when Silver Dragons Stables MechWarrior Brendon Frazer piloted his Copperhead, the Silver Snake, into the Solaris Top Twenty prior to his untimely death. The Silver Dragons commissioned Solaris Arms to develop a new exclusive variant to try and repeat the feat, but the new model's expensive experimental weaponry forced them to allow sales to other interested parties. The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery snapped up a number of the original CPR-HD-002 models. While not increasing the original model's meager four and half tons of armor coverage, Solaris Arms chose to replace the original Durallex plating with ArcShield Reflective Armor to enhance its endurance against the large volume of energy weapons carried by Arena 'Mechs. Already a relatively speedy design, the addition of a Supercharger enhanced its ground speed. Its extremely short jumping distance was neither improved nor removed; instead it was retained to expand a pilot's options in tight terrain. An extra Double Heat Sink, bringing the total to thirteen, is still not enough to keep up with the increased heat produced by the CPR-HD-003's advanced laser weaponry. Allowing the designers to squeeze in the new systems, a cramped Small Cockpit is used, which is less of a liability in the short duration arena battles than on an actual battlefield.

'''Mechs/C-SK1'''

==Description==

The Cossack is named after the mercenary unit Khorsakov's Cossacks in honor of their faithful service to the St Ives Compact. The Cossack is a practice in compromise. Originally requested as the fastest 'Mech that Ceres Metals Industries could produce, the emphasis of the design changed throughout its development to a slow moving, heavily armored light 'Mech. The final design that was accepted became the current incarnation of the Cossack. The Cossack is built on a Taijian Series X Endo Steel chassis to save weight. More weight was cut from the design by using a lightweight Hermes 120 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 97.2 km/h. Six Pitban LFT-65 jump jets allow the Cossack to jump up to hundred and eighty meters, allowing the 'Mech to easily handle most rough terrain. For protection, the Cossack has three tons of armor and has ten heat sinks to handle the heat produced by the weapons payload carried by the 'Mech. Overall, the compromise that created the Cossack has turned it into a light trooper 'Mech that works well as part of a team but alone excels at no one role.

'''Mechs/CGR-XR'''

==Description==

This variant is apparently an attempt by the Jade Falcons to use experimental technology in a combat unit. Originally mistaken for a LAM, the Cougar-XR uses a Partial Wing to extend its jump range to 210 meters. An LRM-15 launcher equipped with Artemis V FCS is located in each side torso, while an ER Medium Pulse Laser provides direct fire. It appears that the Cougar-XR is a standard BattleMech instead of being an OmniMech like its progenitor design.

Khan Marthe Pryde decided to upgrade the 'Mechs her Clan fielded. Rather than waste precious resources designing a new OmniMech from the ground up, she instructed her scientists to improve upon existing designs. The design the scientists chose to modify was the Adder. Though the two 'Mechs are visually similar and share the same weight, the Cougar is slower and better armed.

Conceptualized to be a sniper with a good near field defense the Cougar-D variant relies on a single ERLL and an Ultra Autocannon/10 for long range and dual SRM4 launchers for close range fire. The COU-D might not be quick, but if he closes in after ripping the armor open, these Short Range Missiles have great finishing potential.

A mix of long and medium range weaponry is what makes the Cougar-C variant quite unique. A Gauss Rifle is an absolutely scary main weapon system for a mech of just 35 tons and even the backup weapons are more than enough to strike fear in its enemies heart: 5 ERML will allow the COU-C to stay active and dangerous even after the ammo for the Gauss is depleted.

'''Mechs/CGR-A'''

==Description==

With a focus on indirect fire support, the COU-A fields a pair of Artemis IV guided LRM-20s. If the pilot finds itself in a position with direct line of sight he or she can also rely on a pair of ERML's and a single backup Small Pulse Laser. In total this makes for a lot of firepower in a very small package.

==Description==

The Dart was built when the Federated Commonwealth was looking for BattleMechs that were not ammunition dependent. The 'Mech was built with an all energy weapon arsenal on an extremely high-speed chassis. The 'Mech is capable of speeds of up to 151 kph and is armored with three and a half tons of armor. The 'Mech, while lightly armed, is an exceptional recon 'Mech and also works well in a guerrilla force where its use of energy weapons allows it to operate independently.

'''Mechs/DSR-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Fire Moth is a light Clan OmniMech intended for scouting and infantry support. With a running speed of 162.0 km/h, accelerating up to 216.0 km/h with the MASC system installed on the Mechs chassis, the Fire Moth is easily one of the fastest designs ever created. The Fire Moth's superior speed comes from its 200 XL Fusion Engine. Two tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor force pilots to rely on the mechs speed and manoeuvrability for survival. With most of the mechs mass devoted to the overlarge engine, little free weight is left for the weapons. 2 ER Medium lasers provide the medium range fire power, whilst an SRM 6 and an SRM 4 give extra punch at closer ranges.

==Description==

The Fire Moth G was introduced in the Dark Age. It carries four Improved Heavy Medium Lasers that have been tied into a Targeting Computer. It is also equipped with a Supercharger, which combines with the MASC system to allow the Fire Moth G to reach approximately 250km/h in short bursts. To combat the extreme heat, the ten double heat sinks have been supplemented with a Coolant Pod.

==Description==

Taking advantage of the 'Mech's speed, this configuration acts as an artillery spotter and scout, mounting an Active Probe for detecting hidden units and a TAG system for designating artillery fire. The weapons payload was greatly reduced to fit in the electronics, however, and the Fire Moth A mounts only a single Streak SRM-4 for self-defense.

'''Mechs/ER-1'''

==Description==

Clan Jade Falcon designed the Eyrie to parallel the Cougar, only with slightly less firepower in favor of a more well-rounded combat performance. It was first used in battle on the Lyran world of Zhongshan in 3087. Since then it has been deployed throughout the Clan's Clusters as light 'Mech hunters and fast support. Its distinctive wings, common with later Jade Falcon designs, allow the Eyrie to dissipate heat almost as fast as it gains it. In addition, the Partial Wing adds approximately sixty meters to the Eyrie's 150 meter range.

'''Mechs/FLC-4NB-SAHO'''

==Description==

Originally developed as an anti-infantry and Bug Hunter 'Mech, the Falcon is a highly popular light recon and skirmisher 'Mech. Initially created for the newly formed Star League Defense Force's use in the Reunification War, the popular design remained in production until the destruction of Stormvanger's Hesperus II Falcon line during the Third Battle of Hesperus II in 2789, becoming all but extinct until the arrival of Wolf's Dragoonsin 3005. Well regarded by the mercenaries, the Dragoons upgraded their dwindling number of Falcons in the early 3050s before eventually commissioning Blackwell Industries to restart production of the design in early 3060 to produce advanced Clan-tech versions for their exclusive use, as well as more mundane and affordable versions for the general mercenary market. While originally sporting a weapons array similar to the Locust, Stinger and Waspit was charged to defeat, the Falcon's six tons of StarGuard Type II armor provided it with vastly superior protection, allowing it to outlast them and remain combat effective longer. When it was originally developed, the 'Mech's top speed of 97.2 kph and a jumping distance of one hundred and fifty meters allowed it to keep up with other light recon 'Mechs. But by the 3060s the Falconwas outclassed by newer and faster designs, only its use of a cheaper standard Fusion Engine rather than a more expensive and fragile Light or XL Engine kept buyers interested.

But by the 3060s the Falconwas outclassed by newer and faster designs, only its use of a cheaper standard Fusion Engine rather than a more expensive and fragile Light or XL Engine kept buyers interested.

'''Mechs/FLC-4P'''

==Description==

Originally developed as an anti-infantry and Bug Hunter 'Mech, the Falcon is a highly popular light recon and skirmisher 'Mech. Initially created for the newly formed Star League Defense Force's use in the Reunification War, the popular design remained in production until the destruction of Stormvanger's Hesperus II Falcon line during the Third Battle of Hesperus II in 2789, becoming all but extinct until the arrival of Wolf's Dragoonsin 3005. Well regarded by the mercenaries, the Dragoons upgraded their dwindling number of Falcons in the early 3050s before eventually commissioning Blackwell Industries to restart production of the design in early 3060 to produce advanced Clan-tech versions for their exclusive use, as well as more mundane and affordable versions for the general mercenary market. While originally sporting a weapons array similar to the Locust, Stinger and Waspit was charged to defeat, the Falcon's six tons of StarGuard Type II armor provided it with vastly superior protection, allowing it to outlast them and remain combat effective longer. When it was originally developed, the 'Mech's top speed of 97.2 kph and a jumping distance of one hundred and fifty meters allowed it to keep up with other light recon 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/ALM-XF'''

==Description==

The Fireball was a quick response BattleMech built as a direct result of the Clans' Elemental infantry. As the Clans swept through the Inner Sphere, members of the Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth met with scientists from the New Avalon Institute of Science to discuss, among other things, how to counter their new Battle Armored foes. The result was a 'Mech which on paper met many of the criteria for successfully dealing with Elementals: it had weapons with a high rate-of-fire for taking on swarms of Toads as they were known, had ammunition stores to maintain that rate for extended periods, and an extremely high speed so it could quickly come to the aid of heavier units. These Fireballs were given to units with prior experience fighting the Clans but assigned to rookie pilots, partly because the 'Mech's capabilities fit the personality of many of these new Mechwarriors, partly to more quickly build up their combat experience. The Crucis Lancers, Deneb Light Cavalry and Ceti Hussars were the first regiments to receive these 'Mechs in 3053, employing them immediately on the front lines as raiding along the border between the Inner Sphere and Occupation Zones commenced following the Truce of Tukayyid.

The result was a 'Mech which on paper met many of the criteria for successfully dealing with Elementals: it had weapons with a high rate-of-fire for taking on swarms of Toads as they were known, had ammunition stores to maintain that rate for extended periods, and an extremely high speed so it could quickly come to the aid of heavier units. These Fireballs were given to units with prior experience fighting the Clans but assigned to rookie pilots, partly because the 'Mech's capabilities fit the personality of many of these new Mechwarriors, partly to more quickly build up their combat experience. The Crucis Lancers, Deneb Light Cavalry and Ceti Hussars were the first regiments to receive these 'Mechs in 3053, employing them immediately on the front lines as raiding along the border between the Inner Sphere and Occupation Zones commenced following the Truce of Tukayyid.

'''Mechs/FRB-2EP'''

==Description==

Designed with the aim of upgrading the ageing Firebee with more advanced Star League technology, the 2Ep was still a prototype when the Succession Wars began. The only completed models of this design were lost with the destruction of the Exedor factory in the First Succession War. The design was briefly revived in the 3045, with a few surviving Firebee’s being converted as a showcase of home grown Capellan science and engineering. Armed with an ER Large Laser, dual Streak SRM-2's and augmented with the addition of a Beagle Probe, the 2Ep is a fast scout hunter and skirmisher.

'''Mechs/FRB-1E'''

==Description==

The original Firebee used a single LRM-5 backed up by a trio of SRM-2s. The Primitive Engine provided a top speed of 85 km/h, more than enough to engage armored vehicles and infantry, and supporting heavier units. The lack of jump jets, combined with six and a half tons of Primitive Armor, forced pilots to pay attention to the terrain to insure they could move effectively.

'''Mechs/FS9-M2'''

==Description==

Manufactured on Coventry for the mercenary market in 3101, possibly a descendant of the -B and almost the polar opposite of the -M variant, the -M2 variant of the Firestarter is an upgrade that is built on a Foundation Ultralight Endo Steel chassis and is armored with seven tons of Durallex Nova standard armor. Eleven Double Heat Sinks attempt to keep the -M2 cool, while a single ER Medium Laser mounted in the head and three Flamers in each arm work to tax those same heat sinks.

'''Mechs/FS9-H'''

==Description==

The Firestarter is a dangerous 'Mech for its tonnage, carefully timed attacks with its Flamers can shut down any 'Mech and leave it open to punishment from your other forces. The FS9-H also makes a decent light 'Mech hunter-killer.

'''Mechs/FS9-GS'''

==Description==

The establishment of the Escorpion Imperrio left the Goliath Scorpions with large quantities of sub par equipment and a desperate need to fill the holes in their depleted Touman. Finding themselves with a large quantity of Firestarter FS9-H’s, the decision was taken to outfit them as second line mechs for the new Garrison caste. Designed to serve alongside the hodgepodge mix of MilitaMechs and IIC’s that formed the back bone of both the Solhamma formations and the Garrison caste unit’s; the GS is a cheap upgrade capable of surprising it’s opponents. Fielding a mix of ER Flamers and a pair of Improved Heavy Medium Lasers, backed up by a pair of Light LMG’s; the weapons load out resembles the FS9-A more than the FS9-H. Currently only two dozen of these mechs exist, but with the sheer amount found in Imperrio stockpiles, there is no plan to slow down production anytime soon.

'''Mechs/FS9-B'''

==Description==

The Word of Blake redesigned the Firestarter to produce a new variant in 3070, that could be better integrated into their units. An additional ton of armor is added when compared to the S and it is upgraded to Light Ferro-Fibrous. The chassis has been replaced with an Endo Steel model, and a Light Fusion Engine provides power. Three Flamers are devastating to conventional units, while an ER Medium Laser provides firepower against hardened targets. A C3i Computer allows it to share targeting data from other units. The use of single heat sinks is confusing in such a unit, and it means that the -B can build heat quickly. It uses eight Improved Jump Jets to cover 240 meters in a jump.

'''Mechs/FS9-A'''

==Description==

The original Firestarter model, the FS9-A used Small Lasers instead of Machine Guns and mounted an extra ton of armor.  This caused some heat issues and led to the development of the more familiar FS9-H, with its Machine Guns.

==Description==

This is an Experimental prototype of the Firestarter that was created by Defiance Industries of Kwangjong-ni. Only three prototypes were produced as of 3074, and all suffered from developmental problems with their components. Using the FS9-H as its base, the 'Mech is fitted with an XXL Engine and a pair of Medium X-Pulse Lasers, both mounted in the right arm. Its principle weapon is a Plasma Rifle with 10 shots of ammunition. The 'Mech retains the original base model's Flamers and jump capabilities.

'''Mechs/FLE-FA'''

==Description==

A vicious anti-infantry variant, the origin of the Flea "Fire Ant" is a mystery, with Earthwerks denying the design. It was first seen in the Chaos March, most notably in urban fighting on Carver V, in 3063 and none were spotted after 3068. Possibly the predecessor to the 19 and 20, the exact configuration is not known (if one even exists, as it seems to be a refit variant of sorts). The typical Fire Ant refit removed half a ton of armor in favor of six Machine Guns and three Flamers. It was thought to be a designated pacification unit, in the sense of a SecurityMech, as opposed to a frontline BattleMech design.

'''Mechs/FLE-RS'''

==Description==

A favourite tool of planetary governments through out the Periphery, the Louse is designed for riot suppression. Capable of dispersing riots with lethal and non lethal options, it works well against civilians and lightly armed vehicles while posing no significant threat to actual battlemechs or military grade vehicles. Dual grenade launchers and a mixed laser package provide the bulk of the firepower, whilst a pair of flare launchers provides additional deterrent and can be used defensively in combat. Spall lined armour provides additional protection against infantry grade weapons and a set of sensors designed specifically for peering through cluttered urban environments round out the package. Often deployed as scouts and support forces; this mech is a common sight amongst the pirate bands who find themselves facing it across the battlefield. Not designed for battle, it is nonetheless pressed into service by desperate militias and governments that lack real battlemechs.

==Description==

A Capellan infantry support variant, the 20 strips a half ton of armor to mount two ER Medium Lasers and a Light PPC. The loss of armor is not seen as a risk, since it is replaced with Stealth Armor, along with the required Guardian ECM Suite.

'''Mechs/FLE-19'''

==Description==

This dedicated anti-infantry variant is designed for urban defense, and is not for use against other 'Mechs. Each arm has four Light Machine Guns and a Machine Gun Array. It also utilizes a Flamer that can threaten combat vehicles as well as infantry. A single Rocket Launcher 10 provides a one-shot damage potential against armored targets. The 19 has proven popular with Periphery nations and mercenary units.

'''Mechs/FLE-17'''

==Description==

Originally produced exclusively for the Dragoons until the Capellan Confederation acquired the design's blueprints via a Maskirovka raid during the 3040s, the post-Helm Memory Core FLE-17 variant is based on the older FLE-15 model. Since the Dragoons used the Flea in a recon role more than an antipersonnel 'Mech, Earthwerks conceived a new design by incorporating recovered technology. Retaining the design's maximum speed of 97.2 km/h, the addition of an Endo Steelchassis frees up weight for a MASC system that allows the 'Mech's speed to be pushed up to 129.6 km/h in short bursts. The increase of speed is required to ensure survival on the modern battlefield, as the FLE-17 is only clad in a pitiful three tons of Livingston Ceramics armor plating.

'''Mechs/FLE-16'''

==Description==

Built as part of the Wolf's Dragoons exclusive contract with Earthwerks Incorporated to replenish the Dragoon's losses at the end of the Fourth Succession War, alongside renewed production of original Fleas, the FLE-16 was the first new production model of the extremely rare 'Mech in centuries. The variant remedied the earlier FLE-14's weaknesses by combining incredible speed with additional armor and weaponry on a 20 ton chassis. The engine was upgraded to a GM 180 in order to reach a similar maximum ground speed of nearly 150 km/h. It mounts two Medium Lasers and an Flamer while retaining an armor profile like the earlier FLE-15.

'''Mechs/FLE-14'''

==Description==

Entering production in 2519 the FLE-14 Flea was an attempt to create an ultra-light BattleMech. Weighing a mere fifteen tons, it could arguably be regarded as a different 'Mech design than the true Flea. It was capable of a maximum ground speed of nearly 150km/h with a 120 meter jump capability. Its weapons and armor however were very light: Only one ton of armor protected the unit, and the single Medium Laser mounted in the right arm was barely enough to make it a viable battlefield unit.

'''Mechs/HMR-3S'''

==Description==

The Hammer is a 'Mech that was built to provide fire support for light 'Mechs. The 'Mech is built around a long-range arsenal that can provide both direct and indirect fire support. It is also often paired with the Anvil, using its missiles to soften up the enemy at a distance until the Anvil can bring its lasers to bear. The Hammer has a maximum speed of 86.4 kph, which is enough for a 'Mech intended to stay at the edges of a battlefield acting in a fire support role. Additionally, the 'Mech has a respectable six tons of armor protection. With its average speed and good armor protection combined with its long-range weapons, the Hammer is a good overall light fire support 'Mech.

'''Mechs/HMR-3G'''

==Description==

Developed in parallel with the standard Hammer 3M, the 3G is a cheap side grade designed for garrison and budget conscious buyers. The expensive Endo Steel is removed along with the Artemis IV system, dramatically decreasing the cost and relatability of the mech. Popular with many smaller mercenary units and on backwater garrisons every where through Marik space, the design is liked by Mektechs everywhere for the ease of maintenance and ready supply of replacement parts.

'''Mechs/HM-2'''

==Description==

The Hitman was designed to work as a spotter 'Mech for advanced Arrow IV missile artillery rounds. In order to do this, the 'Mech is built to be able to close to effective range for its Forward-1 Target Acquisition Gear spotting gear rapidly with a Kagushima 210 XL propelling it up to 118.8 kph and a MASC system pushing the 'Mech up to 151.2 kph in short bursts. The 'Mech also carries an Apple Churchill Guardian ECM Suite to foul any enemy electronics warfare equipment and a Wunderland Beagle Active Probe to detect any hidden enemy units. With the recent invention of semi-guided LRMs the Hitman can also guide LRM fire to a unit targeted with its TAG unit. The Hitman carries five tons of armor protection to protect it against any attacks that may hit it.

'''Mechs/HM-1'''

==Description==

The Hitman was designed to work as a spotter 'Mech for advanced Arrow IV missile artillery rounds. In order to do this, the 'Mech is built to be able to close to effective range for its Forward-1 Target Acquisition Gear spotting gear rapidly with a Kagushima 210 XL propelling it up to 118.8 kph and a MASC system pushing the 'Mech up to 151.2 kph in short bursts. The 'Mech also carries an Apple Churchill Guardian ECM Suite to foul any enemy electronics warfare equipment and a Wunderland Beagle Active Probe to detect any hidden enemy units. With the recent invention of semi-guided LRMs the Hitman can also guide LRM fire to a unit targeted with its TAG unit. The Hitman carries five tons of armor protection to protect it against any attacks that may hit it.

'''Mechs/BZK-T2'''

==Description==

Produced by Maverick Industries after Operations Serpent and Bulldog, the TsarBomba is an attempt to improve the flexibility and survivability of artillery units. Noting the loss of many Arrow IV equipped units and the slaughter of their crews during Clan breakthroughs, the Maverick Industries design teams looked for ways to improve the situation. With a license to produce the Hollander BZK-F3 already secured, it was decided to produce an upgraded model that utilised an XL Engine to mount the Arrow IV launcher. Modern artillery tactics called for the deployment of anti air and anti mech units to protect the precious assets, so Maverick only mounted a Small Pulse Laser on the mech, augmented by a TAG; so that the Hollander could handle infantry infiltrators and spot for either it’s own launcher or the rest of it’s lancemates. The designs speed was judged sufficient for it to evade other threats that might threaten the mech, especially with it’s armour unable to stand up to much punishment.

'''Mechs/BZK-P'''

==Description==

The Hollander was introduced in 3054 specifically to carry a Gauss Rifle into combat and act as a sniper. The Federated Commonwealth was in dire need of a response to the fast-moving, long-range firepower of the Clan Invaders at the time, and looked at a number of light 'Mech designs featuring PPCs or LRMs as a potential answer. It was Coventry's unorthodox decision to mount such a large weapon, one that had neither the overheating or ammunition explosion drawbacks of the other designs, which won them the contract. With its single massive cannon and use of rediscovered technology, the Hollander can destroy another light 'Mech in a single hit at extreme range and threaten heavier targets easily.

'''Mechs/BZK-G1'''

==Description==

The G1 variant of the Hollander is built to address concerns about the Hollander's lack of back up weapons. First debuting in 3056 the 'Mech replaces the heavy Gauss Cannon with an LB-X Autocannon/10 as its primary weapon, freeing up weight to mount two Defiance B3M Medium Lasers in its arms as backup weapons and add two tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The G1 is an excellent 'Mech for vehicle hunting as well as anti-aircraft use with its LB-X cluster rounds.

==Description==

The Hornet debuted in 2760 as an urban recon 'Mech, but lack of interest forced the design to be shelved two years later. In 2990, Kallon Industriesrediscovered the blueprints and resumed production. The upgraded HNT-171 started production in 3051. The production line was destroyed by the Capellans in 3069. The 'Mech is designed around the concept of being able to swiftly move through an urban environment with relatively heavy armor. Overall, because of its eclectic mix of weapons and relatively slow speed, the Hornet is only somewhat effective when inside of a city. When caught outside an urban environment the 'Mech is hard pressed to defend itself.

'''Mechs/HNT-172'''

==Description==

A NAIS sponsored modification to the 171 Hornet model, the 172 transforms the mech into a close range ambush fighter. Mounting a pair of experimental Medium X-Pulse lasers and a SRM-2, the 172 is designed to hunt and harass enemy recon units in urban environments. Never entering full production, the limited production of the experimental lasers quickly shelved the 172 design with only a dozen units entering field trials with frontline units.

'''Mechs/HNT-171'''

==Description==

The Hornet debuted in 2760 as an urban recon 'Mech, but lack of interest forced the design to be shelved two years later. In 2990, Kallon Industriesrediscovered the blueprints and resumed production. The upgraded HNT-171 started production in 3051. The production line was destroyed by the Capellans in 3069. The 'Mech is designed around the concept of being able to swiftly move through an urban environment with relatively heavy armor. Overall, because of its eclectic mix of weapons and relatively slow speed, the Hornet is only somewhat effective when inside of a city. When caught outside an urban environment the 'Mech is hard pressed to defend itself.

An upgrade of the 900-D produced for the Blakists in 3070, the 950-D is built on a standard frame and the equipment is stripped out. It is replaced with two ER Medium Lasers and a Snub-Nose PPC. This variant has the most armor of any Hussar variant thanks to its use of a Heavy Ferro-Fibrous weave.

'''Mechs/HSR-900-D'''

==Description==

This variant that only saw limited production in 3067 retains the speed of the original, but is powered by a Light Fusion Engine. The increased weight of the engine required stripping out the weapons and reducing the armor protection from the levels of the 500-D, even with the inclusion of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor. It is armed only with a Light Autocannon/2 that is fed by a single CASE-protected bin, limiting the ability of the autocannon to use special munitions. The 900-D was only in the prototype stage when the Word of Blake attacked Coventry. Afterwards it could be found in service with the Word of Blake Militia.

Built with lessons learned from the Battle of Tukkayid, the 450-D is armed with an LB-5X mounted in the Right Torso. 2 tons of ammo keep the main gun well supplied, whilst a pair of ER Medium Lasers offer provide some degree of deterrence against foes closing in. Rounding out the design is an extra ton of armour, allowing it to weather heavier damage than it's predecessor.

'''Mechs/HSR-400-D'''

==Description==

One of the Clanbuster upgrades developed by ComStar in 3052, the 400-D is an extreme modification of the original Hussar. The ER large laser and the engine have both been stripped from the chassis to make room for a LB-X Autocannon/10 with one ton of ammo, an additional 1.5 tons of armor and a GM 240 XL Engine, reducing the Hussar's speed to 129.6 km/h. This variant of the Hussar, due to the cluster rounds that can be fired from the LB-X Autocannon, performs admirably in anti-vehicle screening forces.

'''Mechs/HSR-350-D'''

==Description==

This Combine variant on the 300-D was introduced in 3038. It lowers the Hussar's top speed to 126 km/h by replacing the engine with a Pitban 240. The weight saved from the smaller power plant was used to add a Medium Laser to each arm and an extra ton of armor.

'''Mechs/HSR-300-D'''

==Description==

The 300-D Hussar is a simple downgrade of the 200-D Hussar, gifted to the Draconis Combine by ComStar in 3035. The primary changes in the design are the replacement of the ER large laser with a standard Defiance B3L Large Laser, standard heat sinks in place of the double-strength models, and replacement of the Ferro-Fibrous armor with standard Riese Reliable armor at a negligible cost to the already weak armor protection.

'''Mechs/HSR-200-DB'''

==Description==

An upgrade of the 200 introduced in 2735 and used exclusively by SLDF Royal units, the 200Db is powered by an XL Engine. This enables an upgrade of the 'Mech's electronics with a Beagle Active Probe and a Guardian ECM Suite in the side torsos. In addition, the armor coverage is increased to five and a half tons.

'''Mechs/HSR-200-D'''

==Description==

The Hussar has a single weapon on its chassis in a unique turreted mount on the center torso, an Extended Range Large Laser. While the use of a single weapon limits the defensive capabilities of the Hussar, the superior reach of the ER laser allows the 'Mech to engage enemies at a standoff range and its speed means the Hussar can dictate the range of the engagement, forcing enemies to fight on its terms. If enemies do get too close the Hussar can still engage in physical combat with kicks and punches but this is less than ideal. Ten double heat sinks are enough to keep the 'Mech cool in combat, but only one and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor makes the Hussar among the least-protected 'Mechs ever built.

The Incubus II only has two torso-mounted ER Medium Pulse Lasers for offensive armament. A Laser AMS system was installed in the head to protect the pilot from missile attacks. The installation of more jump jets and the Partial Wing has reduced the available space for weaponry, but the Hell's Horses found an answer for that problem: They created several hand-held weapons systems that add additional firepower and provide commanders and pilots with some of the tactical flexibility of an OmniMech.

'''Mechs/INC-II'''

==Description==

The Incubus II only has two torso-mounted ER Medium Pulse Lasers for offensive armament. A Laser AMS system was installed in the head to protect the pilot from missile attacks. The installation of more jump jets and the Partial Wing has reduced the available space for weaponry, but the Hell's Horses found an answer for that problem: They created several hand-held weapons systems that add additional firepower and provide commanders and pilots with some of the tactical flexibility of an OmniMech.

'''Mechs/INC-4'''

==Description==

Clan Hell's Horses Incubus 4 completely changes the weapon loadout with an eye to lower cost, but keeps the core purpose of the 'Mech intact. It mounts a Heavy Large Laser, two Medium Pulse Lasers, two Micro Pulse Lasers, and two ER Micro Lasers. It can quickly build up heat in normal combat situations, but most of the Trials it is involved in necessitate disabling multiple weapons, so this is rarely a problem.

'''Mechs/JVN-10P'''

==Description==

The 10P model is an upgrade of the 10N model introduced by the Federated Commonwealth amid much secrecy in 3049. The 10P retains the armor and speed profile of the 10N, removes one of the SRM-6 launchers and replaces it with two Streak SRM-2 launchers. While sacrificing slightly in terms of firepower, this variant is far more ammo-efficient than the original.

==Description==

A customized Jenner for Chu-i Samuli Rinne of the DCMS. The 'Mech's engine was upgraded with a 245 rated XL Engine and 3.5 tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armor. By removing the standard SRM launcher, DCMS techs freed enough room to add CASE and a single LRM-15 with two tons of ammunition. Rinne's Jenner keeps the standard complement of Medium Lasers.

'''Mechs/JR7-K'''

==Description==

Known as Cat among the MechWarriors of Sorenson's Sabres, the personal 'Mech of Grace Shiro has been extensively modified over the years to aid her role as the unit's spotter. Originally trading two Medium Lasers for extra armor, in the lead-up to the War of 3039 her 'Mech was outfitted a less-refined experimental Endo Steel chassis and Ferro-Fibrous armor, allowing the SRM launcher to be replaced with an advanced Octagon Missile Magnet Narc Missile Beacon with three tons of Homing Pods.

The Jenner Hero 'Mech, the Oxide mounts an SRM-4 in each arm supported by a pair of LRM-5s in the center torso. Fitted with ten double heat sinks and carrying a ton of reloads for each missile launcher, such a heavy weapons loadout is made possible through the use of Endo Steel chassis, a downgrade to a 235 rated engine and the removal of Jenner's signature jump jets.

==Description==

Jenner Ds run hot, and they run fast but can quickly bound into combat to deliver a knockout punch, even against heavier units. Their capability with speed and weaponry tends to come at the expense of lower armor capacity, though.

'''Mechs/JR10-X'''

==Description==

An experimental variant of the Jenner developed by Luthien Armour Works  in 3072. Using the JR7-K as its base the designers sought to update the mech with new technology. The internal structure was swapped for a composite version. Its engine was replacede with a 245 rated XL Engine, maintaining the orgiignal speed. The forward jutting cockpit  was replaced with a Torso Mounted Cockpit. The old SRM's were completely dropped in favor of increasing the 'Mech's medium laser armament to six Medium Lasers. For the 'Mech's protection, it has Angel ECM and its hull has been encased with seven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous Armor. For its stealth capacities, the 'Mech has been given an Experimental Null-Signature System. Only seven of these 'Mechs were known to have been built.

'''Mechs/JR7-IICV'''

==Description==

The JR7-IICV was designed to guard the flanks of heavy and assault mechs when fighting combined arms inner sphere forces. It's more heavily armored than most Clan Jenners which gives it improved survivability in heavy combat zones. It's main weapons are a set of machine guns which make quick work of conventional infantry and light vehicles. A pair of heavy medium lasers give it some focused anti-armor punch. Although the design proved effective an unfortunate meme dubbing it a ''Joust tank with legs'' lessened it's popularity among Clan mechwarriors who eschew anything related to armored fighting vehicles and infantry. This mech's intended role does not lend itself to gaining personal glory.

Reportedly piloted by Zane Nova Cat, the Jenner IIC Hero 'Mech mounts a Heavy Machine Gun and twin standard Machine Guns in each arm fed by five tons of Machine Gun rounds and three tons of Heavy Machine Gun ammunition, supported by a single center torso-mounted ER Medium Laser. Defensively the Fury trades speed for armor, mounting an 280 rated XL engine to carry four and half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor.

Clan Nova Cat, the primary users of the Jenner IIC, created this variant after they moved to the Inner Sphere. Though it changes the appearance of the 'Mech, the actual specifications of the design changed little. It retains the Streak SRM-4, but replaced the standard missile launchers with a pair of ATM 3s, each of which is accompanied by a ton of ammunition.

==Description==

The Kit Fox D is configured for indirect fire support, mounting dual LRM-15 racks as well as a LRM-5. A Narc Missile Beacon is also carried, which may be exploited by the Kit Fox D itself, as the targeting systems of Clan LRMs lack a minimum range; this literally allows the Kit Fox D to run up to an enemy and mark them for increased accuracy, and then fall back, firing the entire time.

Primarily for sale to Inner Sphere customers, the Hell's Horses marketing ploy of adopting a familiar designation the 'Mech was dubed the Koshi, a decision that did not sit well with many of the more conservative members of the Clan.

==Description==

Inspired by the success of the Clan Hell’s Horses’ Black Hawk design. Clan Diamond Shark developed what is in essence a simplified, non-Omni version of the older Mist Lynx OmniMech. Primarily for sale to Inner Sphere customers, the Hell's Horses marketing ploy of adopting a familiar designation the 'Mech was dubed the Koshi, a decision that did not sit well with many of the more conservative members of the Clan.

'''Mechs/LCT-3M'''

==Description==

The 3M Locust was built for the Free Worlds League in 3050, with production carried out at both Corean Enterprises on Stewart and Free Worlds Defense Industries on Gibson. It retained the Martell medium laser but replaced the machine guns with four Magna Small Lasers and added a Voelkers Parasol Anti-Missile System in the left arm for missile defense. The armor was upgraded to Kallon FWL Special Ferro-Fibrous with CASE in the left torso to protect the one ton of AMS ammo and utilized a Corean-II Delux Endo Steel chassis. The electronics were also updated to a Garrett T10 B communications system and a Corean CalcMaster targeting-tracking system.

'''Mechs/LCT-3D'''

==Description==

The 3D Locust introduced in 3049 used Star League technology to take the concept of the 1M further. Although it carried only two Magna Longbow-5 launchers, the engineers at Achernar BattleMechs on New Avalon upgraded the armor to Ferro-Fibrous and the structure to Endo Steel. Completely lacking in close-range weaponry this variant was suitable for harassing the enemy at long range then fleeing before they could get too close.

The basic Locust 1V has one big advantage: speed. It's not meant to put up much of a fight, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a 'Mech that goes further and is harder to hit.

'''Mechs/LCT-1M'''

==Description==

The Locust's 1M model is interesting in that it can churn out a decent volley of LRMs for such a small 'Mech. It's a great harasser, especially if you can use its speed to lob missiles into the weaker rear armor of targets. But it normally has almost no armor itself.

'''Mechs/LCT-IIC-4'''

==Description==

This version was redesigned so that it could be produced in the Inner Sphere by Clan Jade Falcon on their Occupation Zone headquarters world of Sudeten. It replaces the small lasers of the standard variant with three General Systems Heavy Small Lasers in each arm. The medium pulse laser has been downgraded to a Series 7Ja ER Medium Laser, while a pair of additional double heat sinks are added to help deal with the increased heat.

==Description==

The Malak is the lightest in the Word of Blake's Celestial series of OmniMechs designed for the Manei Domini. The Malak, Arabic for angel, features a dazzling array of new construction materials in an attempt to free up as much weight as possible in a fast and reliable package. The 'Mech is protected with six tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor which weighs less than standard armor. To free up even more space, the 'Mech mounts an XL Gyro, and a small cockpit in addition to its Endo Steel frame. A C3i Computer allows it to sync with other Manei Domini so equipped. Nine and a half tons are left for modular equipment.

'''Mechs/MW-IIC'''

==Description==

A mixed tech mech based on the Commando IIC, the Mighwar utilises the best clan tech the Imperio can reliably produce. Built using the standard tooling for a Commando, the Imperio is unable to mount or even spare a Clan XL Engine for the design and is instead reliant on an IS standard model procured via the Hanseatic League’s traders. A CASE II protected ammo compartment shields the fragile engine from the risk of an ammo explosion, while standard Clan CASE protects the less risky arm compartment. Built around a 200 rated Fusion Core, the Mighwar maintains a comfortable 128KPH under standard conditions or can reach 170KPH with the aid of it’s MAS. An Improved Heavy Medium Laser and 10 Streak SRM’s make the Mighwar capable of running opponents into the ground and then picking them off with firepower suitable for an Inner Sphere Medium mech; vastly outclassing most of the Periphery trash it is fielded against.

'''Mechs/MON-69K'''

==Description==

Originating from the short lived Concord of Kapteyn, this design was designed to showcase each realms newly rediscovered technology in one show-piece design. Unfortunately the Concord fell apart before the design could be put into production. The Clan Invasion left the Free Worlds League scrambling for new designs that could be used in the fight against the Clans. Among the designs pushed into production was the 69K, redesigned to use modern technologies from across the Inner Sphere. The chassis is sourced from the Combine, whilst the engine is of Lyran make; paired with a FWL built Streak SRM-2 and one of the Capellan Confederation’s newly rediscovered Beagle Probes. Produced at Irian technologies Shiro III facility until the early 3060’s, the mech was sold at cost to buyers; with the FWL subsidising production as part of their contributions to the war.

'''Mechs/MON-68B'''

==Description==

An upgrade to the ageing 68 model, this Mongoose was one of the first models to trial the Combines new C3 Slave unit. Featuring a characteristically minimalist upgrade package, this Mongoose variant served with distinction during Operation Bulldog. An ER Large Laser servers as the sole weapons system, augmented by a new fire control system and the C3 unit. A cheap upgrade, this is a favourite of pilots who were previously assigned a 68; with many praising the enhanced range and accuracy of the Laser. Paired into demi lances, and assigned a C3 Master equipped mech to coordinate, these Mongoose's are deployed as head hunters and long range harassers; both roles that make use of their high ground speed and manoeuvrability. Fast and deadly, they have already made a name for themselves, with one Mongoose formation accounting for 5 kills, including a Star Colonel in a Timberwolf during the Great Refusal.

'''Mechs/MON-67L'''

==Description==

An upgrade to the Mongoose 67, the 67L is a locally produced model used by the Outworlds Alliance. Assigned to the First and Second Long Road Legions, every part of the mech is manufactured in the Alliance, save for the imported TAG system. The Alliance Military Corps provides the Mongoose chassis from their reserve stocks of Mon-67 models. The original medium lasers are swapped for 3 of the Alliances new ER Medium lasers and the small laser is removed altogether. The addition of locally produced Ferro-Fibrous armour allows for a minor gain in protection and the addition of the TAG system. Developed as a fast harasser and spotter, designed to work in concert with the Alliance Air Wings and Planetary garrisons; the design has proven popular among Mongoose pilots as much for it's improved capabilities as it's locally made parts.

'''Mechs/MON-66CG'''

==Description==

Built by Krupp Armament Works under contract for the ComGuard, the 66C was intended for deployment on Tukayyid. Unfortunately the design was unable to be finished in time and Krupp was left with a finished mech that had no prospective buyers. In a deal brokered by Comstar, the company agreed to sell it's finished production to the reformed SLDF and provide them with additional production runs as requested. Built as a fast interdiction unit, the design was designed to chase down and annihilate elemental formations. Armed with 4 small pulse lasers, a medium pulse laser and a Streak SRM-2; the variant performed with distinction throughout the post Tukayyid years and then through Operations Bulldog and Serpent. The Word of Blake invasion choked off the flow of new mechs, as Krupp’s production shifted to the newer designs demanded by the Word.

'''Mechs/OSR-5D'''

==Description==

This Jihad-era variant developed in 3081 drops all the weaponry in favor of a single Heavy PPC. The 'Mech makes room for this by using an XL Gyro and a smaller XL Engine that reduces the top speed to approximately 110km/h. This Osiris variant has a 210 meter jump capability and is protected by Light Ferro-Fibrous armor.

'''Mechs/OSR-4D'''

==Description==

The Osiris was designed to be a fast, hit-and-fade style offensive platform and can perform well in that capacity with its awesome speed, as much as a Locust or Spider, although it does appear to rely too heavily on its mobility to protect it from damage. The Osiris' primary weapons are its five ER Medium Lasers. A variant that was born out of the FedCom Civil War, the 4D drops the missiles and Machine Gun in favor of one Medium Pulse Laser and increased jump jet capacity.

'''Mechs/OSR-4C'''

==Description==

During the FCCW, the Capellan Confederation salvaged a number of Osirises from the Federated Suns. Unsure of what to do with the mech, the Capellans settled on making it into a stealthy raider. Equipped with the Confederation's new Stealth Armor and a bevy of lasers and missiles, the Osiris-4C quickly established itself as capable, if unexceptional. It is often seen alongside the Confederation's Raven-4L stealth mechs working in effective wolfpacks.

'''Mechs/OTT-9S'''

==Description==

The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional. The Ostscout is quick enough to escape most traps, and very few other designs can match it in terms of speed and maneuverability. However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability. In fact were it not for aggressive lobbying on the part of its test pilots the final production model would have been completely weaponless. As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's. The intelligence leak would be confirmed and traced back to Dag Kesselring, former Precentor of the 66th Division, who passed on information about the program to both the Lyrans and Blakists.

'''Mechs/OTT-8J'''

==Description==

The Ostscout OTT-8J was an attempt to make it better scout with more survivability in the modern battlefields. Extra tons of armor, a Bloodhound Active Probe and an Angel ECM Suite ensures its scouting capabilities and increased survival chance, at the cost of having to fit an XL engine and a Compact Gyro. The only armament is a Mediumn X-Pulse Laser.

'''Mechs/OTT-10CS'''

==Description==

The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional. The Ostscout is quick enough to escape most traps, and very few other designs can match it in terms of speed and maneuverability. However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability. In fact were it not for aggressive lobbying on the part of its test pilots the final production model would have been completely weaponless. As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's. The intelligence leak would be confirmed and traced back to Dag Kesselring, former Precentor of the 66th Division, who passed on information about the program to both the Lyrans and Blakists.

'''Mechs/PH4'''

==Description==

The Pack Hunter is the first new design produced by Clan Wolf-in-Exile on Arc-Royal. It also represents a new partnership between Phelan's Wolves and the Kell Hounds, as the armor and communications gear are Kell Hound products, traded to the Wolves in exchange for Endo Steel. Reflecting their Khan's bias towards light, fast designs, Wolf scientists designed the Pack Hunter to be fast and have a sharp bite. Though its four tons of armor are light, the BattleMech is supposed to use its speed and maneuverability to stay out of trouble.

The 'Mech would first appear in combat in 3077 after a considerable amount of delays in its development. The design was originally seen as the OmniMech successor to the original Pack Hunter, however the Blakist attack against Arc-Royal and other priorities caused the delays.

Panther 9Rs are solid all-around 'Mechs, if a bit on the slow side. They make up for it with Jump Jets, considerable armor, and a hefty punch from their trademark PPC. They've even been used in physical slugging matches to good effect.

==Description==

An early version of the Panther that is occasionally seen in the Periphery, it is armed with the ancient Tronel Large Laser in place of the PPC.  This laser suffers from faulty heat exchangers and generates more heat than a standard Large Laser.  Most of these have long since been retrofitted.

==Description==

The 10K Panther is a high tech upgrade of the 9R model introduced by Wakazashi Enterprises. The chassis has been rebuilt using Endo Steel construction techniques and the saved weight used to add an Artemis IV fire control system to the missile launcher, as well as upgrading the PPC to a Lord's Light 2 ER PPC. Since its introduction the 10K has gone on to replace the 9R as the most common model employed by the DCMS.

'''Mechs/PNT-IIC-GS'''

==Description==

Panther 9Rs are solid all-around 'Mechs, if a bit on the slow side. They make up for it with Jump Jets, considerable armor, and a hefty punch from their trademark PPC. They've even been used in physical slugging matches to good effect.

'''Mechs/PNT-IIC'''

==Description==

An overhaul of the Panther, this light sniper is much the same as it's predecessor. Built around a ER PPC and a Streak 6 launcher, the designs city fighting qualities are augmented by a Guardian ECM suite. Like it's predecessor, the Panther IIC is an effective urban warfare infighter and cost effective garrison mech. Used solely in PGC's, the mech resembles the original PNT-9R and often provides a deadly surprise for IS opponents who find themselves outranged by the superior weapons.

'''Mechs/PRA'''

==Description==

The Piranha's main threat is its twelve Series XII Rotary Machine Guns. These are a serious threat to any foe on such a speedy 'Mech, especially if a Star of Piranhas operate in a pack, and such a large array allows the 'Mech to chew through an opponent's rear armor almost instantly. They are most deadly, however, to unarmored infantry, capable of wiping out an entire company in seconds. For work against hardened targets, the Piranha mounts a pair of Mk. 3 ER Medium Lasers and a single Series 1 ER Small Laser. Since the design only uses ten single heat sinks, the MechWarrior must still manage heat levels. The ammunition dependency of the Machine Guns ensure that Piranhas must stay close to supply lines, so most have been relegated to solahma or garrison roles.

==Description==

Loaded with advanced electronic equipment, the D configuration carries a TAG laser designator, a Beagle Active Probe, and a C3 Slave unit. The Raptor D is armed with a short-range arsenal of three Streak SRM-2 launchers and two Small Lasers. To deter infantry attacks, the D configuration has two Machine Guns. The combination of a Beagle Active Probe with TAG and a C3 slave make the Raptor D an excellent point 'Mech for light C3 lances, since it is able to share targeting information with allied units and also find hidden units and designate them for highly accurate artillery fire.

==Description==

The original 3024 prototype of what became the RVN-3L Raven, this was the unit that was pressed into service against the Federated Suns during the Fourth Succession War. With XL engine technology not yet available, the 'Mech mounted a standard Omni 175 fusion engine, giving it a maximum speed of 86 km/h, and was protected by four tons of standard armor. The EW Equipment at the time that this 'Mech was built consisted of a massive 7.5 ton experimental electronic warfare suite that unfortunately did not live up to expectations.

==Description==

The Razorback is a design that excels at little, but is similarly deficient in few areas. hough the design is rather slow for a 'Mech of its size, it is rarely the slowest 'Mech on the field, either. Because of the 'Mech's general reliance on ballistic and missile weaponry, it does not have to worry about overheating under normal circumstances but is dependent on supply trains.

'''Mechs/RZK-11T'''

==Description==

The Razorback is a design that excels at little, but is similarly deficient in few areas. hough the design is rather slow for a 'Mech of its size, it is rarely the slowest 'Mech on the field, either. Because of the 'Mech's general reliance on ballistic and missile weaponry, it does not have to worry about overheating under normal circumstances but is dependent on supply trains.

'''Mechs/RDS-3A'''

==Description==

Produced by Leopard Armor for the Word of Blake, the Red Shift is one of many new BattleMechs being fielded by the Word of Blake Militia. The Red Shift is designed to spot for the Padilla artillery tank, which is also built by Leopard Armor, with its TAG target designator. The Red Shift is built on a lightweight Leopard Mark I Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a GM 180 XL engine that pushes the 'Mech's top speed up to 151.2 km/h. To give the 'Mech the ability to protect itself from advanced electronic warfare systems, the Red Shift has a Guardian ECM Suite. For protection from conventional weapons, the Red Shift has four tons of 1/Star Slab Ferro-Fibrous armor. To dissipate the 'Mech's scant waste heat, the Red Shift is outfitted with ten heat sinks.

A more radical variant removes the jump jets and mounts an ER Large Laser and twin ER Medium Lasers. It retains the Stealth Armor and Guardian ECM, but adds a Targeting Computer to make the lasers more accurate. MASC enables the ST to move in bursts up to 151 km/h.

'''Mechs/SPR-5S'''

==Description==

At the urging of then-Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion, Norse-Storm opened up talks with Shengli Arms to secure Stealth Armor for the light 'Mech. Though the deal did not work out exactly as they had hoped, the 5S incorporates Stealth Armor. Space constraints force the consolidation of the Medium Lasers into one Medium Pulse Laser.

'''Mechs/SPR-5F'''

==Description==

Reintroduced in 3053, the Spector mounts a Magna 245 XL engine in combination with an XL Engine and an  Endo Steel chassis. It carries seven and a half tons of armor along with seven jump jets. The Spector carries a Nightwind Large Laser as its primary weapon,  backed up by a pair of Defiance B3M Medium Lasers and a single Defiance B4S Small Laser for close combat. Defensively the Spector carries a Norse Guardian ECM Suite that allows it to defend itself against advanced enemy targeting and range finding equipment.

'''Mechs/SPR-4F'''

==Description==

The Spector was originally designed by Norse-Storm BattleMechs to be a lighter version of the Exterminator BattleMech, made to hunt down light command 'Mechs. The first Spector rolled off the assembly line on 6 June, 2639, and following extensive testing the SLDF ordered 600. The Star League's enthusiasm for the Spector is due to the BattleMechs stealth capabilities, a Chameleon Light Polarization Shield

==Description==

The 7M was Nimakachi's upgrade of the venerable Spider with recovered Star League technology. Released in 3051 it uses a Crucis-II Delux Endo Steel chassis and three tons of Kallon FWL Special Ferro-Fibrous armor, freeing up weight to replace the two medium lasers with two Tronel XII medium pulse lasers. Many of the components were also replaced with proprietary technology, including Rawlings 75 jump jets, an Omicron 4002 Networking Channel, and a TRSS Eagle Eye targeting system. One thing they could not do however was include an ejection system for the pilot.

'''Mechs/SDR-5D'''

==Description==

The 5D Spider is geared towards anti-infantry work, removing one of the medium lasers and replacing it with a Flamer in the right arm.  However, the combination of its speed with the Flamer can deliver an unpleasant surprise.

'''Mechs/SDR-IIC-2'''

==Description==

A field refit gaining popularity among trueborn warriors, the IIC-2 swaps the Rocket Launchers and Small Lasers for a pair of Streak LRM-5’s and an Active Probe. Designed to complement the Spider IIC and the lighter mechs in the Touman, the IIC-2 can function as a fire support mech or a fast skirmisher as tactics dictate. With two dozen different refits currently in use, the supplies of Streak LRM’s are the only thing preventing this design from going into full production.

'''Mechs/SDR-IIC'''

==Description==

A fast skirmisher and scout, the Spider IIC is a mixtech unit designed with the best technology the Imperio posses. Designed to be hard to hit and harder to kill, the SDR-IIC is capable of ground speeds in excess of 120KPH and can jump a full 240 meters in a single bound. Armed with 6 ER Small Lasers and a pair of Improved Heavy Small Lasers, the IIC is a nasty infighter, capable of catching and holding heavier units in place until support arrives. A pair of Rocket Launcher 20’s provides a one shot punch for emergencies and a Guardian ECM suite interfers with enemy targeting systems. The use of locally made Rocket Launchers and imported Inner Sphere XL Engines help to keep the production costs down and there is expectation that the current output rate could soon increase as this mech goes into full time production.

'''Mechs/STG-5M'''

==Description==

This upgraded version of the Stinger produced by Earthwerks Incorporated on Keystone and Calloway VI took advantage of several technologies that were rediscovered, thanks in part to the Helm Memory Core. The chassis was upgraded to an Earthwerks STG II Endo Steel model, allowing it to carry an additional half-ton of armor. The 'Mech retained the Omicron medium laser but swapped the machine guns for a Lindblad Shotgun Anti-Missile System on its right arm and a Flame Tech Flamer on its left. One ton of AMS ammo was carried in the right torso, while the Datacom 26 and Dynatec 990 electronic systems remain unchanged.

==Description==

A Jihad-era repair yard refit of the venerable Stinger unveiled in 3071, the 3P was built on an Endo Steel chassis and carried, as its only weapon, either a Fusigon Mini or a Lord's Light 3 Light PPC capable of striking a target at up to five hundred and forty meters.

==Description==

The SLDF improved upon the stock Stinger with the addition of many new technologies unavailable when the 'Mech was first designed. Designed as a fast, jump-capable reconnaissance platform, the Stinger has served capably in that role for well over half a millennium, a testament to the utility of the original design.

'''Mechs/STG-IIC-3'''

==Description==

Though the Stinger IIC has a relatively low ground speed by Jihad Era standards, it is still fast enough to act as a harasser unit as well as a recon platform. The 180 meter jump capability is also useful, allowing the pilot to get out of tight terrain very quickly. The upgraded armor protection is valued by those warriors used to the older Stinger as well, but this armor is still too light to allow the 'Mech to operate in a stand up fight. This variant is unique in that it's intended for vacuum operations by Clan Snow Raven. The mech also utilizes Laser Heat Sinks to keep the Stinger IIC cool.

'''Mechs/STG-A5'''

==Description==

In 2680, the Star League requested designers to develop 'Mechs which could fly as well as function as standard 'Mechs. The first Land-Air 'Mech off the drawing board, the Shadow Hawk LAM, proved so fatally flawed, the concept was almost shelved. However, LexaTech Industries reworked the conversion equipment and unveiled the first viable LAM, the Stinger LAM in 2688, based on the old Stinger design. LexaTech's reworking of the concept proved so successful, the Land-Air 'Mech became highly sought after, especially for space combat operations. In fact, the Stinger LAM first saw combat destroying a nuclear weapons facility in the Oort Cloud orbiting Sol, Terra's star. The standard production model uses three Magna Medium Lasers mounted on the head and arms.

The original Stinger LAM used by the Star League Defense Force Royal Divisions, this version carried a Medium Pulse Laser and replaced the Machine Guns with Small Pulse Lasers. Double heat sinks kept the temperature manageable. It was also more heavily armored than its forerunner, carrying five tons of protection.

'''Mechs/WSP-2A-X'''

==Description==

The WSP-2A-X Super Wasp is an evolution of the classic Wasp, a re-design that essentially produced a new BattleMech with even a different tonnage. Weighing as much as a Commando, the Super Wasp maintained the basic ground speed and jump capability of its inspiration, but also added an engine Supercharger which allowed it to sprint at speeds of up to 120km/h.

'''Mechs/THE-S'''

==Description==

Supplied by ComStar to the Draconis Combine as part of Operation Rosebud in 3035, the THE-S was a downgraded factory refit of the THE-N. Stripping out the advanced Endo Steel chassis and CASE, the use of a heavier standard chassis forced a reduction in the Thorns armor protection by half a ton, most of which was removed from the head and rear torso. The communications system was also changed to a more primitive Olmstead 30, although the Omicron VII targeting-tracking system was similar in capabilities to the Orion 80 it replaced.

'''Mechs/THE-NB'''

==Description==

The advanced model employed by the Star League Defense Force Royal Divisions in 2743 changed the role of the 'Mech from a missile to an energy boat, replacing the LRM launcher with an ER Large Laser, retaining one medium laser and downgrading the other to a Small Laser. Dropping the no longer required CASE, the 'Mech also used a MASC system for temporary speed bursts and Double Heat Sinks to vent its increased waste heat output. The THE-Nb mounted an XL Engine to save the weight to mount this extra equipment, at the cost of reduced survivability.

'''Mechs/THE-N2'''

==Description==

A new production variant of the THE-N1 developed by the Word of Blake in 3071, the THE-N2 took its cues from both the THE-N and THE-T variants, swapping the ER-PPC with an MML 7 and the standard small laser for a Diverse Optics ER Small Laser. A two-ton CASE protected ammo bay allowed the THE-N2 to carry both LRM and SRM munitions to make best use of the Multi-Missile Launcher.

'''Mechs/THE-N1'''

==Description==

Developed in 3051 on the orders of Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht to try and close the gap between the Clans and Com Guards, the factory refit THE-N1 received its baptism of fire during the Battle of Tukayyid. Having reached a similar conclusion that resulted in the THE-Nb, the CASE was dropped and the standard engine was swapped for an XL Engine to allow the standard weaponry to be stripped for an all energy weapon array: a right arm mounted Kinslaughter H-Class ER PPC and a head-mounted Intek Small Laser. This new weapons array, enhanced by double heat sinks, added a level of lethality never seen before on the Thorn.

The Thorn carries a weapons array that is not usually seen on light 'Mechs: a Zeus-5 LRM launcher mounted in the right arm with one ton of reloads in the right torso, paired with two Hellion Spitfire Medium Lasers split between the head and left arm. Four and a half tons of armor provides the Thorn with good protection, especially when mated with CASE to contain any ammunition explosions.

'''Mechs/TR-A-11'''

==Description==

Produced in 2546, the Toro was the Taurian Concordant’s first battlemech design. Based on captured Firebees, the Toro is a long range support mech.  Armed with a PPC and a pair of LRM-5s the Toro carried two tons of ammo and 10 single heat sinks. The last Toro factory was demolished in 2598 by invading Star League troops and production would not resume until the Word of Blake Jihad.

'''Mechs/TR-A-1'''

==Description==

The original prototype of the Toro, the A-1 was based of the primitive Firebee developed by the Cappellan Condederation. It had two SRM-2s which shared a ton of ammunition and a Large Laser. Though it could only manage 64 km/h, the A-1 had more armor protection than the Firebee, with ten and a half tons of Primitive Armor protecting the mech.

'''Mechs/UM-R8Q-B'''

==Description==

A customised model, this RQA-B was one of the original prototypes, built prior to the first production run. Full of technological upgrades that never made it into production, this mech is equally deadly at range and close quarters. Featuring 3 PPC’s, first generation heat dissipation armour and a unique FCS built to maximise the damage potential of the weapons; this Urbanmech has claimed many unwary opponents. Piloted by one of Damage Inc’s senior officers, this mech is equally notorious among Damage Inc’s opponents and allies.

==Description==

Don't let the stubby 'Urbie' fool you, it may look like a walking trash can, but it can mount heavy armor and a grown-up-sized Autocannon. R60s aren't known for their speed, but they are very useful if you can draw the enemy into their firing range.

'''Mechs/UM-AIV-N'''

==Description==

This variant of the UrbanMech replaces the standard weaponry with an Arrow IV missile launcher and ER Medium Laser. It requires an Endo Steel chassis and Small Cockpit to provide room, and the UrbanMech can only carry ten rounds for the Arrow system. Despite these limitations, it is still a decent fire support unit.

'''Mechs/UM-RLG'''

==Description==

Built under orders from the FWL military, this Urbanmech was intended to showcase the Leagues new series of Light Gauss rifles. Politics – however – had other ideas and the project was passed onto a team that included a former Dark Shadows member who sought to turn the mech into a long range sniping platform. Under their direction, a Chameleon LPS system was incorporated into the design, along with a TAG system for target spotting. Sacrificing some armour to include the added bulk of the stealth systems, this Urbie makes a surprisingly good sniper with 3 jump jets providing the mobility it needs to move around and the LPS allowing it to sit for days at a time unnoticed, until the target walks past. The inclusion of the LPS was considered to expensive by the Chief Armour and the project was subsequently cancelled with only 3 prototypes made; all of which disappeared into the hands of SAFE.

'''Mechs/UM-RCR'''

==Description==

Illegal mech racing is a common occurrence in the cramped tunnels under Solaris city and no mech is more infamous than the Urbie RaceCar. Appearing in 3082, this converted Urbanmech has won numerous races, often surviving ambushes and dirty tricks that have gutted lesser racers; in the process claiming a cult following among racing fans. Little is known about it's pilot or the modifications that enable it to go so fast. Though it is speculated that a Supercharger/MASC combo is paired with a hand built engine using surplus aerospace parts to achieve its high speeds. Lightly armed, it has still claimed many unaware opponents with well placed bursts of HMG fire to the back. More recently, it has spawned a host of imitators, though none have achieved the originals level of success or indeed survival; with most crashing and burning in spectacular accidents early on in their careers.

'''Mechs/UM-R96'''

==Description==

One of the latest UrbanMech variants, the UM-R96 is an evolution of the -R80. It drops all the weaponry bar the Snub-Nose PPC to mount the hardened armor of the -R93 model. The standard small laser remains, although now of the X-pulse variety. This creates an incredibly tough 'Mech with minimal logistics needs, which is perfectly suited to combat in an urban environment—but nowhere else.

'''Mechs/UM-R8Q'''

==Description==

Designed as a collaboration between the reborn Damage Inc mercenary group and a consortium of FedSuns manufacturers, this refit package is designed to emulate the power of an Awesome for a mere 6th of the original cost. Cheap and easy to maintain, these Urbie Awesomes saw action during the 4th succession war and numerous brush wars that followed. Sadly the continued proliferation of Helm Core related technologies and the technological renascence of the Clan invasion, relegated these mechs to back water obsolescence; with the last surviving example lost in 3072.

==Description==

This Urbie is primitive repurposing at it’s best, but it works. A salvaged wreck of an Urbie, this has been dragged off of the battlefield and crudely repaired with parts taken from industrial mechs and ancient weapons. Little more than a mobile turret, it looks and sounds scarier than it is.

==Description==

This Free Worlds League variant upgrades the autocannon to an Ultra Autocannon/10 and the laser to an ER Small Laser. This is all made possible by the upgrade to five tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and the removal of the eleventh heat sink. While the ultra-class autocannon provides superior firepower, it can also eat through the single ton of ammunition at an alarming rate.

==Description==

A production model of the R60LRM debuting in 3082, at the request of the Federated Suns who were looking for cheap garrison units that could provide indirect fire support capabilities. An endo steel chassis and ultra light gyro allow the original LRM-20 to be swapped for the new Enhanced LRM-20 and the Medium Lasers to be upgraded to extended range models. Still mounting single heat sinks and standard armour to cut production costs, this Urbanmech is a perfect militia unit – if kept away from the frontline

'''Mechs/UM-R60LRM'''

==Description==

A simple conversion, often seen among mercenary units; the UM-R60LRM or LRMbie is an attempt to provide cheap fire support. The AC/20 is replaced with an LRM-20 and 2 tons of ammo, while 2 medium lasers are added to the mech; for improved mid range efficiency. Cheaper and easier to maintain then the expensive AC versions, the LRMbie is proving surprisingly popular amongst it's pilots. The longer reach of the LRM pairs better with it's slower ground speed and has led to claims that it improves the mechs survivability rates in combat situations. With Helm Core technology becoming increasingly widespread, many owners plan to mate the LRM with the increasing range of speciality munitions, creating an effective support mech that can provide everything from mine laying capability to indirect fire support in a cheap package. A number of examples are known to have been obtained by various manufactures, who are keen to experiment with the design.

'''Mechs/UM-R60-LAM-MKII'''

==Description==

Based on the flawed UM-R60-LAM prototypes, engineers attached to the NAIS attempted to reverse engineer and upgrade a number of prototypes recovered from the Orguss Cache on Marcus. Armed with a UAC/2 and a ER Medium Laser, the Engeineers took inspiration from classic Urbanmech designs and attempted to the turn the limited speed and maneuverability into an advantage. With a few tweaks to the placment of it's Jump Jets, the LAM became a very stable firing platform, ideal for ranged support work. Whether the project was a success is unkown, as the chaos of the Civil War forced the prototypes back into mothballs and the records were sealed.

'''Mechs/UM-R60-LAM'''

==Description==

A long lost prototype produced by Orguss Industries, this LAM was a failed experiment. Designed to capitalise on the Star League LAM tech, the UM-R60-LAM is a mech without a purpose. To slow for front line combat or special operations work and not nimble enough for dog fighting at close range, Orguss struggled to find a willing buyer for their wonder machine. Armed with a large pulse laser and a single small laser, it lacked the range of it's ground based counterparts or rival LAM models. Rumour has it that Orguss sealed the unsold models in a storage cache and forgot about them; and that the cache has survived the chaos of the succession wars.

'''Mechs/UM-R26'''

==Description==

A complete rebuild of the R25, this new chassis draws inspiration from the RetroTech designs flooding the periphery arm’s markets. Built with a mixture of periphery and advanced tech, the center piece of this mech are the heavy rocket launchers that enable this mech to go toe to toe with foes, many times it’s weight class. It’s relatively high cost and limited production, has so far kept it confined to the more advanced periphery nations.

'''Mechs/UM-R25'''

==Description==

Taking inspiration from the R20 series of mechs, this urban mech was designed from the ground up; to be a cheap and nasty ambusher aimed at the mercenary market. The combination of stealth armour and rockets allow it to savage targets and withdraw.

'''Mechs/UM-LAM'''

==Description==

Based on fragmentary Star League era plans, the Urbanmech LAM is not surprisingly; poorly suited for LAM operations. Built by the self proclaimed professor of Cluffs Stand, Mencius Horvat; using a mixture of stolen Urbanmech parts and Lostech recovered from throughout the Periphery. Slow by LAM standards and drastically under gunned by Urbanmech standards, this mech struggles to fill either role. That said, the shock factor of an Urbanmech LAM deployed against uninformed opponents, has allowed it a measure of success when used as a raider. Dual ER Mediums and a bevy of rockets provide a nasty punch at close quarters, but prove mediocre at longer ranges.

'''Mechs/UM-AIV'''

==Description==

This variant of the UrbanMech replaces the standard weaponry with an Arrow IV missile launcher and ER Medium Laser. It requires an Endo Steel chassis and Small Cockpit to provide room, and the UrbanMech can only carry ten rounds for the Arrow system. Despite these limitations, it is still a decent fire support unit.

'''Mechs/UM-IICR'''

==Description==

A refit designed for garrison troops, the Urbanmech IICr was as a stop gap upgrade utilised by Clan Snow Raven and later the Raven Alliance; to guard against piracy attacks on their frontier holdings. Trading the traditional IIC armament for a pair of Heavy Large Lasers and enough heat sinks to keep it more or less functional in combat, it is capable of delivering a knockout punch against adversaries far exceeding it’s own weight . The raw fire power of the Heavy Lasers forces the pilot to alternate their firing sequences to minimise heat build up or risk a shutdown. Never a popular mech, it found a new life as a training mech in the Alliance armed forces; teaching sibko the importance of heat management and battlefield awareness.

'''Mechs/UM-IIC-2G'''

==Description==

A prototype that only ever entered limited development, the 2G swaps the standard HAG-20 for a Gauss rifle. An XL engine freed up the tonnage needed to mount the rifle and allowed for the incorporation of a light active probe. Needless to say, this wasn’t popular with most the warriors assigned to it. Production was eventually cancelled in 3074, due to unacceptably high losses under combat conditions.

==Description==

The UrbanMech IIC is a Clan IIC-style upgrade of the original UrbanMech. Around the same time as the development of the OmniMech during the Golden Century, Clan Coyote technicians reworked this venerable design. They studied battle data from as far back as the Amaris Civil War and used this research as the basis for their upgrades.

The VAL-NT-JX, Hot-Knife, is a prototype Valiant that trades out the MASC and Hatchet for a Shield and VibroBlade with an Actuator Enhancement System. This means that the Hot-Knife is slower but more durable and even deadlier in close combat.

'''Mechs/VLK-QE'''

==Description==

A uniquely Lyran take on the VLK-QD, this refit transforms the fire support mech into a light scout hunter with the firepower to engage much heavier prey. The standard LRM is swapped for a streak-6 and a second pulse laser, providing a heavy punch, at the expense of range. Produced by Corean Enterprises at their New Avalon facility exclusively for the Arcturan Guards, the design never saw wide spread deployment. Designed to complement the QD, standard tactics called for mixed lances of QD and QE’s; with the E’s flushing units out for the D’s LRMs and then finishing off damaged opponents. A cheap upgrade, the design had many detractors; most of whom criticised the lack of long range fire power or the over heating issues that stemmed from the refusal to upgrade to DHS. The design ceased production during the FedCom Civil War, with the Guards choosing to invest in newer Lyran made variants following the war.

'''Mechs/VLK-BA'''

==Description==

Built as an experimental test bed by Corean Enterprises, using samples of recovered Capellan stealth armour; the Black Adder is as a multi role harasser. Lacking the means to manufacture or reverse engineer the Stealth armour, Corean Enterprises only produced a few production runs of this mech. More a series of modifications to their successful QD design, than a new mech; the design is nonetheless distinctive in its own right. The first stealth mech produced by their New Avalon facility, it relies on a combination of speed and manoeuvrability to survive in combat. A pair of X-Pulse Lasers provide blistering fire power at short range, while an MML-5 with a variety of munitions is capable of providing long range support or direct fire capabilities. Most of the production run were assigned to the New Avalon plant as testing models or to their attached corporate defence force and as such were lost during the Jihad.

'''Mechs/WSP-1P2'''

==Description==

An improved 1-P, this upgrade package uses scavenged tech to improve the 1-Ps scouting ability.  Using minimal upgrades, all purchased or acquired at great cost, this refit package is available for anyone with the contacts or cash to afford it. The new active probe is capable of spotting most threats long before they can see the Wasp, whilst the removal of the RL-15 takes away most of it’s offence punch, it allows for the addition of a knock-off AMS system to better protect the mech. Endo Steel is used to provide the weight savings for the probe, though it’s limited availability and high cost limit the number of these conversions produced. Popular among pilots and the chop shop owners refitting them, this upgrade is expected to spread through the Periphery in the near future, as the technology required becomes easier to acquire.

'''Mechs/WSP-1P'''

==Description==

A common Periphery rebuild, this mech is a mix of different weapons systems. A primitive medium laser copied from the original Wasp model provides subpar fire power, backed up by the one shot punch of an RL15. A small calibre rifle makes for a semi effective sniper weapon whilst its ammo lasts. The rest of the mech is almost standard spec, rebuilt by a succession of engineers to specs nearly identical to Inner Sphere counterparts. Surprisingly enough, this rebuild offers somewhat superior capabilities compared to most Inner Sphere models. Produced in any number of Periphery junk yards and back alley chop shops, this mech is incredibly common amongst periphery factions;  who field the mech in vast quantities, praising its cheap firepower and easily repaired chassis.

'''Mechs/WSP-1'''

==Description==

Developed by General Mechanics on Mars in 2464 as the first generation Wasp, this version used several primitive components. The primitive engine reduced the top speed to 85 km/h and meant that only a single medium laser was carried. The prototype jump jets could only cover 150 meters in a jump. The primitive armor provided much less protection than the later Succession Wars-era Wasps, even though it carried three and a half tons of armor.

'''Mechs/WSP-100 LAM MK I'''

==Description==

This variant, used by the SLDF, has a LTV 150 engine, slightly lower maximum ground speed (84km/h), a 120 meter jump capability, and replaces the SRM-2 with a rear-facing One-Shot version. In exchange the WSP-100 was equipped with a five ton bomb bay. This Bomb Bay allowed the WSP-100 to carry Arrow IVmissiles and conventional bombs without losing any speed.

'''Mechs/WLF-2X'''

==Description==

Developed by Arc-Royal MechWorks, the extensively modified WLF-2X variant utilizes experimental technology. Using an Endo Steel chassis and an extra-light engine to save weight, the 2X's main weapon is a right-arm mounted Heavy PPC enhanced by both a PPC Capacitor and an Actuator Enhancement System.

==Description==

As a 'laser boat' the Wolfhound's very basic weapons array frees it from supply lines and allows for superior endurance during extended campaigns. The primary long-range weapon is a Cyclops XII ER Large Laser mounted in the right arm, which allows the Wolfhound to strike at ranges of nearly 600 meters.

==Description==

The original Wolfhound model, produced from 3028 until the introduction of the WLF-2 variant. The pre-Helm Memory Core WLF-1's primary weapon is a standard Setanta Large Laser, making its striking distance shorter than that of the later model, while its ten standard heat sinks did not dissipate as much waste heat as the newer double heat sinks used on the WLF-2.

'''Mechs/AGT-1A'''

==Description==

Developed by Majesty M&M from battle data gathered in engagements with the Word of Blake's patterns of Phoenix Hawk BattleMechs, the Agrotera is a fast, hard-hitting Medium 'Mech packed with some of the most cutting-edge technology available. An XL 300 fusion engine and 240-meter jump capacity give the Agrotera excellent agility for it's weight class, while 9.5 tons of armor keep it reasonably safe against the hits that do land. The Agrotera is no slouch giving hits back, sporting an ERPPC linked to an advanced Actuator Enhancement System, backed by a Medium VSPL. A single normal Medium Pulse Laser and a pair of Small Pulse Lasers round out the Agrotera's arsenal and leave it well equipped to handle virtually any battlefield threat, entirely independent from supply line restrictions.

'''Mechs/APL-4M'''

==Description==

The Apollo is designed to be a long range fire support BattleMech. This is accomplished by mounting an engine on the 'Mech that gives it a top speed of only 64.8 kph and eleven and a half tons of armor. The 'Mech was then armed with massive missile launchers which can rain destruction down on an enemy. While the Apollo has less than average speed for a medium 'Mech, if it is employed correctly the Apollo should have nothing to fear from enemy fire; it is fully capable of staying at the edge of the battlefield and laying down suppressive LRM fire.

'''Mechs/APL-1R'''

==Description==

The Apollo is designed to be a long range fire support BattleMech. This is accomplished by mounting an engine on the 'Mech that gives it a top speed of only 64.8 kph and eleven and a half tons of armor. The 'Mech was then armed with massive missile launchers which can rain destruction down on an enemy. While the Apollo has less than average speed for a medium 'Mech, if it is employed correctly the Apollo should have nothing to fear from enemy fire; it is fully capable of staying at the edge of the battlefield and laying down suppressive LRM fire.

==Description==

The design of the Arctic Wolf is simple: get close, unleash a torrent of missiles, and get out. To do this, it is armed with six Type 1 SRM Six-Shooters and two Type 1 Cross-Pattern SRM-4 Launchers. Aiding the accuracy of these missiles is the Tracker Series Narc Missile Beacon. The Arctic Wolf also boasts an impressive four tons of ammunition for its launchers. The 'Mech has ten double heat sinks which can be overwhelmed, but only if a MechWarrior insists on staying in the fight or going full-tilt for long periods. The Arctic Wolf is protected by six tons of standard armor.

'''Mechs/ASN-23'''

==Description==

The -23 variant of the Assassin is an upgrade of the original model using Lostech; originally seen as a standardized field modification, in 3067 new production began at Hellespont 'Mech Works. The SRM-2 has been removed to upgrade the Medium Laser to a Medium Pulse Laser and an Artemis IV fire control system has been added for the LRM-5 launcher. Within the CCAF, TDF and MAF it is largely used as a cheap way to rebuild shattered forces and sees service mostly in green and reserve formations. The Capellans in particular use the -23 as a fire-support unit for pursuit and strike lances, though shortages of Artemis munitions means many are forced to use mine-delivery missiles.

'''Mechs/ASN-101'''

==Description==

Keeping the top speed of the ASN-21 as well as its base weapon load of missiles, the ASN-101 is a rare Federated Suns variant that drops two jump jets and a half ton of armor to mount a trio of Small Lasers, giving the ASN-101 a much better close-in punch compared to its progenitor.

'''Mechs/ASNII-O'''

==Description==

The Assassin II is the result of a Federated Suns specification calling for a 'quick strike harasser unit'. The Maltex Corporation proposed a major redesign of their older Assassin chassis, the resulting BattleMech exceeded all expectations and has started to see use as a counter to the stealth technology employed by the Capellan Confederation.

==Description==

The primary configuration of the Black Lanner is effective at all ranges. At long range, it can make use of an ER Large Laser and LRM-10. When it closes in, it can attack with a pair of ER Medium Lasers and an SRM-6 that can exploit holes in its opponent's armor. An ECM Suite protects it from many forms of electronics.

'''Mechs/BJ-4'''

==Description==

Many Blackjacks in the Federated Suns were upgraded to this model during the FedCom Civil War. A half-ton of armor is removed, though it is upgraded to Light Ferro-Fibrous, resulting in almost the same amount of armor protection. All the weapons of the BJ-2 were stripped out and a Light Fusion Engine was included to free up additional mass. Each arm mounts a Light Autocannon/5 and an ER Medium Laser, while two tons of CASE-protected ammo in each torso allow the BJ-4 to make use of special munitions. A Targeting Computer makes all the weapons more accurate.

==Description==

In the 3030s, the St. Ives Compact experimented with recovered technology on some of their Blackjacks. One prototype that showed great promise replace the autocannon and one heat sink with a pair of Ceres Arms Smasher PPCs. Three of the remaining heat sinks were replaced with experimental “freezer” double efficiency units.

Much like the Firestarter OmniMech, the genesis of the omni-Blackjack stems from the Combine's technology exchange program during the initial Clan Invasion with Ceres Metals Industries ' St. Ives Compact branch offering Luthien Armor Works specifications and licences to manufacturer the ill-regarded Blackjack.

'''Mechs/BJ-2'''

==Description==

The BJ-2 was introduced in 3052 by the Federated Suns as the new production model of the Blackjack, based on earlier experimental designs. It upgrades the 'Mech with two Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Lasers in place of the autocannons and removes the medium lasers for four Hovertec Streak SRM-2 launchers, two each in the left and right sides of the torso. One ton of ammo for the launchers is kept in the left torso while the standard heat sinks were upgraded to double heat sinks.

==Description==

This early Blackjack prototype started along a completely different path for the 'Mech.  Focusing on close in weapons, the BJ-1X has four Flamers and four Medium Lasers.  The BJ-1X also focused more on speed than jump manueverability, increasing the engine size while removing the Jump Jets.

==Description==

Originally debuting in 3054, Solaris Arms' ponderous Bombard favors the all or nothing approach, prioritizing overwhelming firepower over speed. Little more than a walking turret, the Bombard packs a heavy weight punch for its fifty-ton weight, relying on it overwhelming its targets before its pathetic mobility can be exploited, a trade off only a few MechWarriors were willing to consider, among them Mad Dog MacNaughton.

The original Bombard mounted a pair of massive Autocannon/20s in place of the Thunderbolt launchers as well as standard Medium Lasers instead of the MBM-013's ER lasers. This version was also equipped with experimental War of 3039-vintage double heat sinks, less bulky than standard double heat sinks, but which utilized corrosive coolant.

'''Mechs/BSW-HR'''

==Description==

A derivative variant of the old Bushwacker prototypes, the High Roller uses an XL275 engine and Endo-Steel structure to field an AC/10, LRM-5, three Medium Lasers, and a pair of Machine Guns. While it's enhancements increase the damage output of these weapons, it still suffers from the prototype models' electronic systems, especially in its TTS and FCS. This means that while powerful, the High Roller requires an above-average warrior to land a hit.

==Description==

The Bushwacker was originally a failed BattleMech designed to have a smaller forward profile to make the 'Mech a harder target to hit. The Bushwacker's unique design caused problems with the engine shielding, the side-effects of which manifested themselves as various gremlins in the 'Mech's on board electronics on the prototypes fielded.

==Description==

The Bushwacker was originally a failed BattleMech designed to have a smaller forward profile to make the 'Mech a harder target to hit. The Bushwacker's unique design caused problems with the engine shielding, the side-effects of which manifested themselves as various gremlins in the 'Mech's on board electronics on the prototypes fielded.

'''Mechs/BSW-P2'''

==Description==

Built for increased field endurance, the P2 moves the X1's ER Large Laser to the right-arm mount that previously held the AC/10 and installs the X2's twin Medium Pulse lasers in the center torso. Retaining the LRM-5s and Machine Guns, any loss in protection by removing the Ferro-Fibrous armor and CASE is mitigated be carrying more standard armor made possible by a swap to an Endo Steel frame. A single ton of missile and machine gun reloads each and sixteen double heat sinks give the P2 good endurance in battle.

==Description==

A missile boat in the mold of the X2, the P1 moves one of the left-torso LRM-5 launchers to the right torso, retaining the X1's center torso mounted ER Large Laser by replacing the AC/10 with lighter AC/5 and removing the Machine Guns. Removing the CASE, the P1 also exchanges the Ferro-Fibrous armor of the standard Bushwacker for an Endo Steel frame, the extra weight saved allowing it to carry three tons of LRM missiles, two tons of autocannon rounds and mount thirteen double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/BSW-L1'''

==Description==

The Bushwacker was originally a failed BattleMech designed to have a smaller forward profile to make the 'Mech a harder target to hit. The Bushwacker's unique design caused problems with the engine shielding, the side-effects of which manifested themselves as various gremlins in the 'Mech's on board electronics on the prototypes fielded.

'''Mechs/CN11-YLW3'''

==Description==

The Centurion OmniMech was born out of a desire on the part of Corean Enterprises to expand the company's market share. Manufactured primarily at the Corean Enterprises' site on New Avalon and weighing in at 50 tons, the Centurion mounted a Magna 250 XL engine, allowing it to run at 86 km/h, and mounts nine and a half tons of standard armor. With ten fixed double heat sinks, the Centurion has 24 tons of pod space available, almost half the total weight of the 'Mech, and the most common variants of the Centurion echo the various variants of the original Centurion BattleMech developed over the centuries.

'''Mechs/CN9-YLW2'''

==Description==

A second, later configuration of the Yen-Lo-Wang. Commonly referred to as the CN9-YLW2, it is still based upon a CN9-A chassis but uses more modern equipment. Keeping the speed the same, the engine was changed to an extra-light version. The AC/10 has been upgraded to a Gauss Rifle with two tons of ammunition. Three medium pulse lasers, two in the left arm and another rear-mounted in the center torso, replace the old standard ones. A left arm Hatchet is paired with Triple-Strength Myomer.

'''Mechs/CN9-D9'''

==Description==

Built by Jalastar Aerospace in 3071 as a testbed for newer technologies, the D9 modifies the D. It utilizes Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, and upgrades the amount of protection to the specifications of the D5. It also mounts a Compact Gyro, though the design does little to utilize the space that is made available. The autocannon is replaced with a Plasma Rifle, which is fed by a two-ton ammo bin. Like the upgrade to the D5, the D9 mounts two ER medium lasers in the chest and upgrades to double heat sinks. Perhaps the most notable upgrade, however, is the inclusion of torso-mounted jump jets that enable the Centurion to leap up to 180 meters at a time. The heavier armor and bulky jump jets gives these Centurions a more hefty look, causing some observers to mistake them for brand-new 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/CN9-D5'''

==Description==

This variant of the Centurion, introduced in 3062, is inspired by the CN9-D and uses the same engine and chassis. The 'Mech uses MASC to allow it bursts of speed reaching up to 129.6 kph while the weapons compliment has been completely removed. In their place the 'Mechs primary weapon is a Rotary Autocannon/5, backed up by two ER medium lasers. To direct this firepower, the 'Mech uses an advanced Targeting Computer and the 'Mech carries a C3 Slave unit to allow it to share targeting data with its lance mates.

'''Mechs/CN9-D3D'''

==Description==

The D3D variant of this 'Mech is a potent long-range sniper, first built in 3060. It uses the same chassis and engine combination as the D3 variant but uses MASC to augment its movement to give it a maximum speed of 129.6 kph. The primary weapon on the D3D is a Light Gauss Rifle. For added long range assistance, the 'Mech carries an LRM-10 launcher and for close range combat it carries an ER Medium Laser. This is all protected with eight tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor.

'''Mechs/CN9-D'''

==Description==

The D variant of the Centurion, introduced in 3049, is the first of many upgrades using Star League technology. The chassis was re-engineered to use Endo Steel construction techniques. Next the power plant was changed from the standard engine to an GM 300 extralight engine, increasing its maximum speed to 97.2 km/h. Finally, the weapons were upgraded. The Autocannon/10 was swapped for a Mydron Excel LB-X Autocannon/10 and an Artemis IV fire control system was added to the LRM launcher. The two medium lasers were retained.

'''Mechs/CN9-AL'''

==Description==

The AL variant of the Centurion tends to trade the larger burst damage of an Autocannon for more Energy weaponry and heavier armor. ALs can take an incredible amount of damage for their size but still pack a good punch.

'''Mechs/CN9-AH'''

==Description==

A somewhat radical departure from the stock Centurion, the CN9-AH Variant trades out the stock AC10 and Medium Lasers for a single AC20.  While this amounts to the same degree of firepower, it has the benefit of concentrating the damage to a single location.

'''Mechs/CN11-OX'''

==Description==

The Centurion OmniMech was born out of a desire on the part of Corean Enterprises to expand the company's market share. Manufactured primarily at the Corean Enterprises' site on New Avalon and weighing in at 50 tons, the Centurion mounted a Magna 250 XL engine, allowing it to run at 86 km/h, and mounts nine and a half tons of standard armor. With ten fixed double heat sinks, the Centurion has 24 tons of pod space available, almost half the total weight of the 'Mech, and the most common variants of the Centurion echo the various variants of the original Centurion BattleMech developed over the centuries.

'''Mechs/CN11-OP'''

==Description==

The Centurion OmniMech was born out of a desire on the part of Corean Enterprises to expand the company's market share. Manufactured primarily at the Corean Enterprises' site on New Avalon and weighing in at 50 tons, the Centurion mounted a Magna 250 XL engine, allowing it to run at 86 km/h, and mounts nine and a half tons of standard armor. With ten fixed double heat sinks, the Centurion has 24 tons of pod space available, almost half the total weight of the 'Mech, and the most common variants of the Centurion echo the various variants of the original Centurion BattleMech developed over the centuries.

'''Mechs/CN10-B'''

==Description==

A heavier 55-ton version of the venerable Centurion, the CN10-B was built in 3057 and uses an Endo Steel chassis to save weight on the design while retaining the CN9-A's original ground speed through the use of a 220-rated standard fusion engine. Much like the CN9-D, the 10-B carries an LB-X Autocannon/10 as its primary weapon with an LRM-10 launcher with an Artemis IV fire control system, but these are backed up by a medium laser and a medium pulse laser.

'''Mechs/CLN-7VQ'''

==Description==

The Chameleon was designed to help a new MechWarrior master the skills of maneuvering and heat management, with a top speed of 97.2 kph and a jumping distance of one hundred and eighty meters. The 'Mech also had an almost all energy weapons loadout, but cooled only by ten standard heat sinks. This paucity of freezers forces MechWarriors to concentrate on the 'Mech's heat levels. In some instances, the Chameleon had been forced into combat situations, notably during the Dragoon Civil War. Production of the Chameleon halted briefly in 3052 when Defiance Industries decided to switch its production to the Nightsky, but was quickly resumed when J.B.

'''Mechs/TRC-4B'''

==Description==

The Chameleon was designed to help a new MechWarrior master the skills of maneuvering and heat management, with a top speed of 97.2 kph and a jumping distance of one hundred and eighty meters. The 'Mech also had an almost all energy weapons loadout, but cooled only by ten standard heat sinks. This paucity of freezers forces MechWarriors to concentrate on the 'Mech's heat levels. In some instances, the Chameleon had been forced into combat situations, notably during the Dragoon Civil War. Production of the Chameleon halted briefly in 3052 when Defiance Industries decided to switch its production to the Nightsky, but was quickly resumed when J.B. BattleMechs Incorporated purchased the rights to the design. J.B. BattleMechs also introduced two battle-worthy variants of the Chameleon. The Chameleon is a training 'Mech, intended to simulate a variety of opponents by mounting a wide variety of weapon systems. A Chameleon is a medium 'Mech, but it doesn't always look like one.

==Description==

This Chimera variant introduced in 3069, carries a C3 Slave unit and replaces the standard weaponry with a Snub-Nose PPC, Small Laser, Small Pulse Laser, and a quartet of Medium Lasers. It also carries a Sword in the right arm, and uses Triple Strength Myomer to maximize damage. It's also equipped with a larger XL Engine that permits a cruising ground speed of 76km/h. When the Triple Strength Myomer activates, it reaches a maximum ground speed of 120km/h. The 2K also has a 210 meter jump range.

==Description==

The Chimera is built around a combination of an Endo Steel chassis and a 240 XL engine which allows the mech to carry an eclectic mix of weapons. The 'Mech has, as its primary weapons, an ER Large Laser, that provides the Mech with long range firepower and an MRM-20 launcher that provides a powerful medium range punch. For close combat, the Chimera is armed with a ER Medium Laser and a Machine Gun. Rounding out the design is six jump jets that allow the 'Mech to jump up to one hundred and eighty meters and 7 seven tons of armor which provide adequate protection.

'''Mechs/CDA-X5'''

==Description==

Cicada Hero 'Mech is supposedly a prototype of an advanced Cicada. Outfitted with Ferro-Fibrous Armor, Double Heat Sinks, an XL engine, and Endo Steel skeleton, it still manages to outpace all medium 'Mechs and almost all light 'Mechs. Its armament is optimized for short range, with four medium lasers and a pair of SRM-2s fed by an experimental ammo system, giving it a light armament by medium 'Mech standards, but still much better than the older 2A, 2B, and 3C variants. Though the design was highly successful in testing, a combination of the extreme price of production, the relative fragility of the 'Mech, and the difficulty of piloting the 'Mech due to its extreme speed and higher inertia (as compared to comparably fast light 'Mechs) prevented the X-5 from entering production. The few prototype models deployed in combat after testing concluded proved to be a deadly force on the battlefield. Lessons learned with this model were applied to the 3F variant, though the missile capability was dropped due to jamming issues.

'''Mechs/CDA-3X'''

==Description==

Rushed into production during the Jihad, the Cicada 3X is a fast and stealthy raider. Introduced in 3075, it uses a 280 XL engine, freeing up weight for a pair of MML-7’s and a pair of Medium X-Pulse Lasers. The MML’s are fed by 4 tons of ammo, giving them tactical flexibility at all ranges. A small cockpit is added to free up the space for a Guardian ECM suite and the ubiquitous Stealth Armour favoured by the Capellan Shadow Lances.

'''Mechs/CDA-3M'''

==Description==

The 3M upgrade of this older BattleMech uses some of the newest technology available at its introduction in 3049. It uses an extralight version of the same Pitban 320 engine, freeing up extra space to upgrade the small laser to a Small Pulse Laser and adding an Ultra Autocannon/5 to the left torso. The new ballistic weapon is fed by one ton of ammunition stored in the right torso and protected by CASE in the event of an ammunition explosion. The Star Slab armor has also been replaced with Durallex Light, although the amount of protection is the same as in the 2A.

'''Mechs/CDA-3K'''

==Description==

A Combine rebuild of captured 3E’s, this design swaps the LRM-15’s for a pair of MRM-20’s and 2 tons of ammo, augmented by an Artemis IV system. Assigned to the Ghost Regiments and the Legions of Vega, these Cicadas are typically employed as scout-skirmishers and scout hunters. Unfortunately the limited ammo and lack of serious protection has lead to many mechwarriors petitioning for reassignment to other units or refusing to pilot these mechs. The Procurement Department on the other hand, is thrilled that it can offload these retrofitted Cicadas to units who have no choice in the matter. Nonetheless pilots who can master this design, report satisfaction with it’s performance and many have turned to field conversions to improve it’s endurance. The most commonly one reported is the installation of an Endosteel skeleton allowing another ton of ammo or the installation CASE II.

==Description==

The 3F Cicada is one of the most advanced versions of this 'Mech, its upgrades based on combat reports from the front lines of the Clan Invasion, and was introduced in 3052. The chassis has been constructed using Endo Steel construction techniques and the 'Mech is protected with six and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The 3F is powered by an extralight engine and carries a weapons loadout that appears to be a cross between the 2A and 3C models. The primary weapon is an ER PPC, which is backed up by two medium lasers. What's more the Cicada can now jump up to two hundred and forty meters thanks to the inclusion of eight jump jets.

'''Mechs/CDA-3E'''

==Description==

A somewhat unusual design, this fire support mech is popular among the more advanced periphery states and with many mercenary commands. Refitting a standard 2A with an XL Engine, Gibson Federated stripped the weapons and replaced them with a pair of LRM-15’s and 3 tons of ammunition. Conceived as a relatively cheap support mech, with the speed to keep up with lighter scout elements and enough ammunition to last most engagements, it has maintained steady sales since it’s introduction and convinced Gibson to refit one of their older 2A production lines; to produce this variant. Deployed by everyone from the FWL to the Outworlds Alliance, this mech has been spreading across the IS and is a common sight among defensive garrisons. Critics of the design note it’s lack of armour and CASE whilst proponents praise it’s low cost and tactical flexibility.

'''Mechs/CDA-3D'''

==Description==

A succession wars attempt at turning the Cicada into a fire support platform, the 3D is widely considered as failure. Armed with 2 lrm-5's and 2 medium lasers, it relies on a 280 rated engine to fit the heavier arsenal. Despite possessing more firepower and armour than other Cicada models, it's lack of speed and raw fire proved a major draw back and only a few survived through succession wars.

'''Mechs/CDA-3C'''

==Description==

The Cicada 3C is slightly slower than the 2A but has more room for weaponry and armor. It still generally underperforms in most areas except speed, but it can put up more of a fight, with better survival rates.

'''Mechs/CDA-2P2'''

==Description==

A typical Periphery raider, the Cicada 2P is fast and hard hitting but lacks endurance and cannot survive long once it has delivered it's payload. 4 RL-20's make up the bulk of the mechs firepower, capable of threatening even an Assualt mech if used correctly. The secondary weapons are a pair of medium chem lasers with a ton of ammo between them. Achieving almost identical speeds to its Inner Sphere counterparts, the 2P is designed as a heavy scout and head hunter with a nasty alpha strike capable of shredding most opponents regardless of the target. Designed to be easy to maintain and even easier to replace, the 2P is built with parts that can be salvaged from most battlefields or brought in any number of back street bazaars or disreputable arms markets. Indeed, most new 2P’s are often repurposed wrecks hauled off the battlefield and rebuilt as quickly as possible.

'''Mechs/CDA-2A'''

==Description==

In all honesty, Cicadas as a rule are very fragile. The 2A model was designed to be as fast as any light 'Mech, but that massive engine leaves little room for much else. Still, if you use it cautiously, it can be a successful scout and diversion.

'''Mechs/CDA-IIC-4'''

==Description==

Intended to support protomech and light armour formations with accurate LRM fire, this Cicada is a favourite of the Raven Alliance and Hell’s Horses. Using a Cicada 3E as the base, Clan designers stripped out the LRM’s for a pair of Streak 15’s. The IS XL Engine and heat sinks are swapped for clan alternatives, improving survivability and somewhat ironically; addressing many of the key criticisms of the 3E’s design. The only flaw in the design, is the lack of alternative munitions, though the 4’s intended purpose and the Clan rules of engagement render this criticism invalid. The Raven Alliance have begun a conversion of the sizeable stock of 3E’s they inherited from the Outworld’s Alliance, whilst the Horses regularly face the E variant whilst raiding neighbouring space; making this an easily produced conversion.

'''Mechs/CDA-IIC-3'''

==Description==

An alternate configuration of the IIC-2, the IIC-3 was created after careful analysis of battle data and maintenance records. A simple modification, it swaps the ER PPC for an ER Large Laser and uses the remaining tonnage to upgrade the Small Pulse Lasers to Medium Pulses. The paired stars of the previous designs, well effective; were an extravagant waste of resources for a PGC unit. The new design blends elements of both designs together, creating a package that can handle a wider range of roles and is cheaper to produce. The only real complaint is the loss of the TAG, but new doctrine that pairs 2 TAG equipped designs and 3 IIC-3's alleviate this to a degree.

==Description==

Designed for garrison work on captured Inner Sphere planets, this variant entered production shortly before Operation Revival. Intended to hunt vehicles and light mechs this variant trades the ER Mediums for an ER PPC and a pair of Small Pulse lasers, though it loses it’s TAG to make room for the PPC. Designed to work in concert with the IIC-1, the designers intended for the 1 to operate in a scouting and hunter killer role, whilst the 2 provided ranged support. Though widespread among the clans, this design and its twin are seen as unsuitable for frontline combat; leading to most being deployed amongst Provisional Garrison Clusters and Watch Operatives.

Intended to hunt infantry and battle armour, this variant trades the ER Mediums for Medium Pulse lasers and a pair of ER Small lasers. Designed to work in concert with the IIC-2, the designers intended for the 2 to provide long range cover and heavy fire power, whilst the 1 designated targets for artillery and hunted lighter targets. Though widespread among the clans, this design and its twin are seen as unsuitable for frontline combat; leading to most being deployed amongst Provisional Garrison Clusters and Watch Operatives.

'''Mechs/CDA-IIC'''

==Description==

A retrofitted Cicada 2F, first used by Goliath Scorpion in the golden century, as a test bed for their new active probe system. Building on the original 2F, this variant utilizes a newly developed XL engine to provide the free weight needed for it's enlarged payload. 5 ER Medium Lasers provide solid fire power and the addition of a Hell's Horses Light TAG allows the Cicada to work with attached artillery or air assets; either as a scout or a hunter killer. The addition of double heat sinks allows for a more tolerant heat curve; otherwise the mech is unchanged in design. A cheap and effective scout in the absence of omni mechs, the design has spread throughout the clans as a second line and training mech.

'''Mechs/CLNT-2-3T'''

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. This custom model exchanges the Autocannon/5 with a Large Laser and four Heat Sinks.

'''Mechs/CLNT-ESTWD'''

==Description==

The Clint was first created in 2607 as a direct result of the Star LeagueArmaments Act, a law meant to provide border areas with the latest in battlefield technology. The next version, CLNT-2-3T, was mass produced starting in 2608. The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. Its Sloan 220 Lockover T&T System in particular shines as it is simple to use and provides the pilot with excellent battlefield data. Although the 'Mech has limited ammunition reserves for its autocannon, the Sloane 220 ensures that whatever the Clintshoots at, it hits.

'''Mechs/CLNT-6S'''

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. The 6S variant put into production following the fall of Hesperus II to Blakist forces at the outbreak of the Jihad, the 6S uses the 5U as a base, dropping the jump jets in favor of a larger 280-rated XL engine and Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor. Two ER Large Lasers provide long-range firepower with only two ER Medium Lasers as back up, while the TAG and C3 unit have been removed and a Small Cockpit used to make room for a head-mounted ER Small Laser.

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. The 5U Clint is a complete rework of the design, adopted by the Lyran Alliance Armed Forces on the eve of the FedCom Civil War. It is constructed using an Endo Steel chassis and is powered with a Light Fusion Engine, freeing up weight for a Maxell ER Large Laser as its primary weapon. This is backed up by three ER Medium Lasers. The 5U also carries an advanced C3 slave unit and a TAG spotting laser to allow it to designate targets for friendly units.

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. Produced by the Taurian Concordat at the outbreak of the Jihad, the 3-3T modifies the original 2-3T. It adds Ferro-Fibrous armor to the design and swaps out the AC/5 with a Light AC/5, presumably supplied to them by the Word of Blake. This lighter weapon makes room for the inclusion of CASE and two tons of ammunition, ensuring it is able to carry various types of munitions.

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. This variant of the Clint carries two Autocannon/2s in place of the single AC/5, giving it one of the longest ranges possible on such a small chassis. It also bears a single Medium Laser as a secondary weapon. Like the 1-2R variant, the 2-4T also has no jumping capability.

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. The Clint 2-3U is a Capellan field upgrade of the Clint that strips all of the armaments from the chassis and replaces them with more potent and enduring weaponry, the most radical of which is the primary weapon. The AC/5 has been replaced with an ER PPC while both the Medium Lasers were replaced with Medium Pulse Lasers; as a result, it runs much hotter than the original. The 3U also packs double heat sinks in place of single models and is more deadly in combat.

'''Mechs/CLNT-2-3T'''

==Description==

The Clint was primarily designed as a cheap recon unit, with the capabilities of a well-armed, low-end medium weight 'Mech, and in this regard it served well. With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. The Clint 2-3T equipped with one Autocannon/5 with one ton of ammunition. As secondary weapons, the Clint carries two Martell Medium Lasers. This well-balanced mix of weapons when combined with the Clint's above-average maneuverability for its size make the Clint a highly effective multi-role BattleMech.

With a top speed of 97.2 km/h and a jumping capability of one hundred and eighty meters, the Clint can easily keep up with other recon elements and maneuver through mountainous or urban terrain. The 2-2R Clint is an even more cheap refit of the original variant, equipping primitive, cheaper weaponry, that periphery states can afford.

==Description==

When General Aleksandr Kerensky led most of the Star League Defense Force into exile in 2784, they brought prototypes of the Clint BattleMech with them. After the annihilation of Clan Wolverine, Clan Snow Raven revisited these prototypes and was able to begin mass-production of the 'Mech in 2830 and introduced 2842. They ensured that it kept up with advances in Clan technology, eventually becoming the design that is now known as the Clint IIC. This variant developed by Clan Snow Raven's S-Teams to be used in space combat. For its usage in space, the 'Mech has been given five Improved Jump Jets and to reduce handling problems in space the weapons array consists of low-recoil energy weapons.

They ensured that it kept up with advances in Clan technology, eventually becoming the design that is now known as the Clint IIC. Developed during the Jihad in 3073, the Clint IIC 2 was fitted with an all-energy weapons configuration. The 'Mech mounts five Medium Pulse Lasers divided amongst its center torso, left torso, and right arm; one in each of the torso locations, and the remaining three in the arm. This variant has been provided eight Improved Jump Jets to greatly enhance its mobility in tactical situations. To cope with the new levels of heat, ten Double Heat Sinks are used instead of the single versions. Additionally, an ECM Suite has been allocated to the head. Lastly, Ferro-Fibrous armor now protects the design in place of the original Standard armor.

They ensured that it kept up with advances in Clan technology, eventually becoming the design that is now known as the Clint IIC. This speedy medium 'Mech is armed with a Type KOV LB-10X Autocannon and a pair of Series 2d ER Medium Lasers. This makes the Clint IIC an effective light 'Mech killer. It is capable of ranging far beyond supply lines thanks to its four tons of ammunition, though it only uses ten standard heat sinks and seven tons of standard armor.

'''Mechs/HND-4'''

==Description==

This Conjurer variant uses an XL Engine to achieve the same speed as the original, but saves weight for added components. A short-range powerhouse, the designers included four Heavy Medium Lasers that max out the fourteen double heat sinks. Despite that, they also included a Medium Pulse Laser and two Streak SRM-6s to aid to hunting battle armor. For work against conventional infantry, it includes two Light Machine Guns. A Targeting Computer improves the accuracy of the lasers.

==Description==

The Conjurer 2 uses a 350 XL fusion engine to achieve speeds up to 119 km/h, along with increased jumping capacity that enable it to move up to 210 meters a jump. The weapons are removed to make way for an ATM 9 that has three tons of ammunition to allow maximum flexibility. A pair of Medium Pulse Lasers that are tied to a Targeting Computer round out the weapons.

'''Mechs/HND-1'''

==Description==

The Conjurer  is a fast, inexpensive medium BattleMech that excels at medium to short range. As befitting its status as a second-line 'Mech, the Conjurer uses a standard engine, though it is constructed on an Endo Steel chassis and uses eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Its jump jets enable it to leap up to 180 meters at a time. Armed with a Large Pulse Laser, the Conjurer can fall back on paired ER Medium Lasers and Streak SRM-2s for closer range combat. Ten double heat sinks are able to keep heat under control.

==Description==

Based on the Crab that Judith Faber piloted during the Battle of Tukkayyid, this model named Florentine, this variant is a virtual mini-King Crab mounting an Ultra AC/5 in each arm supported by a left-torso mounted LRM-5 and a right-torso mounted Medium Laser. Carrying one ton of LRM missiles and three of Ultra Autocannon rounds, the Florentine's weapon loadout is made possible through use of a 250 XL Engine and an Endo Steel frame.

Repurposed by a Goliath Scorpion Seeker who recovered it from a lost Brian Cache, this CRB-27b has undergone an extensive restoration effort. Sporting Clan tech weapons, augmented by a targeting computer and an active probe; this Crab aids the Seeker in their search for Star League relics. Surprisingly, the design mounts jump jets – enough to leap 150 metres at a time- an unusual addition to the Crab. Intended to aid in exploration work, they have surprised many opponents in combat or a circle of equals, helping to contribute to the Seeker's many victories.

'''Mechs/CRB-27'''

==Description==

Crab 27s fulfill an oft overlooked role, that of a skirmisher with firepower. Wielding strong energy weapons, the Crab delivers a punch at nearly all ranges, with no ammunition constraints. The blend of firepower, heat efficiency, and speed make the Crab the perfect 'Mech to raid enemy positions.

==Description==

This ridiculous experimental carries three Bombast Lasers on a prototype Crab chassis designed to reduce the Lasers' immense heat generation. Is it scary? Yes. Effective? Only in arctic conditions. Just evade it once and watch it try to cool off. Do NOT get hit by its Alpha though...

==Description==

Designed in 2719 during the last days of the Star League, the Crab was built as a medium-weight raider and guerrilla fighter for the Star League Defense Force. Although lacking hand actuators or jump jets, it possessed good overland speed and its all-energy weapons payload was suitable for long-range missions without the prospect for resupply.

'''Mechs/CNS-TD9'''

==Description==

The Cronus was designed by Angus Gilmour to be a cost-effective 'Mech for use by mercenaries and small Periphery units using scrapped military equipment. After retiring from service with the Free Worlds League Military in the 3rd Succession War, Gilmour and many ex-technicians he recruited began working for the family business, Gilmour MilTech, on his home planet Talitha. While Gilmour MilTech would spend much of its time rebuilding/restoring wrecked equipment, technicians with free time constructed small numbers of the Cronus. An inexpensive, hand-built design, the Cronus combines design aspects of many different 55-ton BattleMechs seen on the modern battlefield.

The Cuirass main armament is the Rotary AC/5 carried in the left arm. Identical to the weapon used on the Legionnaire and Blade BattleMechs, this weapon can easily knock smaller opponents right off their feet. Three tons of ammunition keeps the Cuirass fighting for a long time. Unlike the Legionnaire the Cuirass can close with an enemy unit and finish it off with either its ER Medium Laser or (if it needs to cool down) the two ton Sword mounted in the right arm.

'''Mechs/DMO-5K'''

==Description==

The Daimyo is named for the title used for warlords from the medieval Japanese empire. The 'Mech, first produced in 3053, attempts to live up to the heritage of its name admirably. It is armed primarily for long range combat but can hold its own if the situation warrants it. The Daimyo's maximum speed of 86.4 kph and its Nissan 200 fusion engine make the Daimyo a rugged 'Mech that can survive an amazing amount of damage, while bringing the fight to the enemy.

==Description==

The Dark Crow is a Clan Snow Raven developed Second Line BattleMech, which was produced only at its Inner Sphere facilities in the Outworlds Alliance after the Jihad. Named after a strange cave-dwelling bird found on Dante, the 'Mech has proven to be a popular design among Second Line troops. This variant of the Dark Crow appears to be a hybrid of the original Dark Crow and the Dark Crow 2, the ER Large Laser, which has been replaced with a standard Heavy Medium Laser and an advanced Targeting Computer, a configuration similar to that found on the Dark Crow 2.

'''Mechs/DV-P'''

==Description==

While the primitive Dervish 1S was decommissioned from military use throughout the Inner Sphere by 2990s, it experienced a resurgence in the Periphery in the civilian sector. The Dervish 1S-F is a makeshift design initially cobbled together from scrap heaps but later produced as a standard variant on low-tech worlds. Primarily designed to start controlled fires in remote areas, the loadout of the 1S heavily favors incendiary weapons. With a top speed of only 64 km/h the unit cannot out-run fires, so the cockpit is designed with additional heat shielding and environment controls. The limited jump range of 120 meters is sufficient to navigate ravines and other natural obstacles.  Due to the civilian control several units have fallen into pirate or rebel hands and are used as makeshift terror platforms. Frequently used for extortion, the design has come to be known as the 'Bandit' through those areas where it remains common.

'''Mechs/DV-9D'''

==Description==

This upgrade of the -8D introduced in 3068 removes the missile launchers and replaces them with four MML 5s with five tons of ammunition to provide flexibility in the usage of munitions. The saved tonnage was used to add an additional double heat sink, though the heat management system can be quickly overtaxed at short range. Eleven and a half tons of armor improves the 'Mech's durability and a Targeting Computer was added to aid the accuracy of the lasers.

'''Mechs/DV-8D'''

==Description==

The 8D Dervish utilizes some of the newest technologies available at the time of the variant's introduction in 3062. The 'Mech is built with an Endo Steel chassis and is powered by an extralight engine. It also carries two more tons of armor than the 6M model. The weapons carried by the 8D are two LRM-15 launchers with an Artemis IV fire control system, while the SRM launchers and medium lasers were removed for four ER Medium Lasers.

'''Mechs/DV-7P'''

==Description==

The 7P is a Medium Range Missile Boat, carrying an MRM-20 and MRM-10 in each arm, supported by a Medium Laser in each arm and side torso. Such a heavy loadout while retaining the Dervish's usual seven and half tons of armor and five jump jets is made possible with an 275 rated extralight engine and Endo Steel frame. The 7P is fitted with ten double heat sinks and carries a combined four tons of MRM reloads.

'''Mechs/DV-7D'''

==Description==

The 7D Dervish is a 3047 upgrade of the design using Star League technology. The 'Mech is built with an Endo Steel chassis and also uses eight tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor with CASE for protection against ammunition explosions. With the saved weight, the SRM-2s have been upgraded to Federated SuperStreak SRMs and the 'Mech uses double heat sinks. This variant was first produced by Achernar BattleMechs on New Avalon.

'''Mechs/DV-6M'''

==Description==

The Dervish carries as its main weapons two Federated 10-Shot LRM launchers. These missile launchers give the Dervish the long-range capability needed to provide fire support to friendly units and are safely embedded in the torso as opposed to the exposed launchers on other 'Mechs. A ton of ammunition per launcher provides sufficient endurance for any but the most prolonged battles. For close combat, the Dervish carries two Federated 2-Shot SRM launchers and two ChisComp 39 Medium Lasers. The SRM launchers are completely self-contained within the forearms, allowing them to be aimed quickly, and fed by a ton of ammunition each. The lasers are placed just above the launchers and ensure the 'Mech is still capable of fighting should it run out of missiles. The Dervish is capable of jumping 150 meters and is protected by seven and a half tons of armor.

'''Mechs/DV-1S'''

==Description==

The original version of the Dervish that was produced in 2520 was not up to the same standards as contemporary Terran Hegemony designs. The use of comparatively "primitive" parts resulted in a heavier cockpit, engine, and less efficient armor. Consequently, the 1S had a top speed of 64 km/h and could only jump ninety meters. While the missile launchers were the same as the 6M, it did not have that version's lasers. 1S variants continued to exist in militias, but were raided for parts during the Succession Wars. It was not intended for front line use, but for Militia units.  Though there were few, if any, remaining by the end of the 2990s, they once again began to be produced on low-tech worlds during the Jihad due to that conflict's disruption of supply lines.

==Description==

The Enfield was originally designed to replace the Wyvern as an urban combat 'Mech, but the design never made it to mass production. The plans for the Enfield were lost during the Succession Wars and were recovered by the Federated Suns on the world of Achernar in 2870. Knowledge of the design was kept hidden until the 3050s, when the NAIS selected the Enfield as a companion 'Mech to the Enforcer. The Enfield began production in 3055 and has seen heavy deployment to the Lyran Alliance because of the constant threat presented by the Clans. The 'Mech carries eleven tons of StarGuard III armor with CASE to protect against ammunition explosions. The Enfield is built on a Blackstone MD2E Endo Steel chassis and uses a Magna 250 XL engine which gives the 'Mech a top speed of 86.4 km/h to save weight, allowing it to carry a heavy arsenal. Due its extra-light engine, however, the 'Mech developed an undeserved reputation for being fragile in heavy combat.

==Description==

The Enfield was originally designed to replace the Wyvern as an urban combat 'Mech, but the design never made it to mass production. The plans for the Enfield were lost during the Succession Wars and were recovered by the Federated Suns on the world of Achernar in 2870. Knowledge of the design was kept hidden until the 3050s, when the NAIS selected the Enfield as a companion 'Mech to the Enforcer. The Enfield began production in 3055 and has seen heavy deployment to the Lyran Alliance because of the constant threat presented by the Clans. The 'Mech carries eleven tons of StarGuard III armor with CASE to protect against ammunition explosions. The Enfield is built on a Blackstone MD2E Endo Steel chassis and uses a Magna 250 XL engine which gives the 'Mech a top speed of 86.4 km/h to save weight, allowing it to carry a heavy arsenal. Due its extra-light engine, however, the 'Mech developed an undeserved reputation for being fragile in heavy combat.

'''Mechs/ENF-5D'''

==Description==

First walking off the production line in late 3050, the 5D Enforcer is a major upgrade to the standard 'Mech, meeting many of its pilots' desire for something faster, better-protected and with more endurance. The Nissan 200 engine has been removed and replaced with a Magna 250 Extralight Engine, increasing the Enforcer's top speed to 86.4 km/h and the amount of space available for other additions. The armor has been stripped from the 'Mech and replaced with StarGuard CIV Ferro-Fibrous armor with CASE to protect against an ammunition explosion while the weapons payload has also been changed. Retaining the small laser both the Autocannon/10 and the Large Laser were replaced for a new Mydron Excel LB-X Autocannon/10, fed by two tons of ammunition, and a BlazeFire Sweetshot ER Large Laser. Finally, an additional jump jet was added, increasing the jumping distance by thirty meters to keep up with the Enforcer's new speed profile.

'''Mechs/GTL-1OC'''

==Description==

Intended to cripple and capture enemy units, the C configuration's principal tool in its mission is a TSEMP Cannon found in the left arm. Its offensive weaponry includes a single Snub-Nose PPC and a Light Autocannon/5 found in the other arm. Both arms' lower actuators have been removed to allow the 'Mech the flexibility of flipping its arms. CASE II has been added to the right torso to prevent any ammunition explosion effects from crippling the 'Mech's engine and arm weapons. One additional heat sink is added as well.

'''Mechs/D2X-G'''

==Description==

Produced from the Gibson Federated BattleMechs factories on Gibson for a brief period in the 3070s prior to the destruction of Gibson in 3078 at the hands of forces from the Principality of Regulus, the Gestalt was the first and only BattleMech in the Machina Domini class of 'Mechs. The 'Mech was given the name Gestalt not by the Word of Blake, who manufactured it, but by the rebel forces on Gibson who faced it in combat; although the design was only at the prototype stage, the Gestalt underwent extensive field-testing on Gibson in a range of roles, from ambush duties making full use of the combination of Angel ECM and the Void Signature System to interdiction, recon and high-speed pursuit.

'''Mechs/GST-90'''

==Description==

Developed as a complement to the Griffin in the later years of the Jihad, the Ghost is a medium strike 'Mech that saw considerable use in the years after the formation of the Republic of the Sphere. Developed by the Lyran Commonwealth and elements of the former Free Worlds League the Ghost carries an extensive array of electronic warfare equipment into combat. A Beagle Active Probe allows the Ghost to find enemy units, while Stealth Armor and a Guardian ECM Suite allows the 'Mech to live up to its name. With excellent land speed and formidable medium-range weaponry, the Ghost is ideal for hunter-killer and heavy raiding missions, especially when paired with Griffins.Another variant introduced in 3133 removes the SRM-6 rack from the standard Dark Age Ghost and replaces it with a Chainsaw to minimize logistical needs, or potentially to disguise it as an IndustrialMech.

Developed by the Lyran Commonwealth and elements of the former Free Worlds League the Ghost carries an extensive array of electronic warfare equipment into combat.

With excellent land speed and formidable medium-range weaponry, the Ghost is ideal for hunter-killer and heavy raiding missions, especially when paired with Griffins. This variant developed in 3087 replaces the standard weapons with a pair of Large Pulse Lasers, an ER Small Laser, and a single SRM-6. Built around an Endo Steel skeleton, this version uses a Defiance 300 Light Fusion Engine and standard armor with CASE to protect itself.

With excellent land speed and formidable medium-range weaponry, the Ghost is ideal for hunter-killer and heavy raiding missions, especially when paired with Griffins. This Ghost variant introduced in 3082 is popular with mercenary commands and is available for purchase by anyone. The key difference is the Stealth Armor has been removed and replaced by conventional armor.

'''Mechs/GST-10'''

==Description==

Developed as a complement to the Griffin in the later years of the Jihad, the Ghost is a medium strike 'Mech that saw considerable use in the years after the formation of the Republic of the Sphere. Developed by the Lyran Commonwealth and elements of the former Free Worlds League the Ghost carries an extensive array of electronic warfare equipment into combat. A Beagle Active Probe allows the Ghost to find enemy units, while Stealth Armor and a Guardian ECM Suite allows the 'Mech to live up to its name. With excellent land speed and formidable medium-range weaponry, the Ghost is ideal for hunter-killer and heavy raiding missions, especially when paired with Griffins.

'''Mechs/GLD-5R'''

==Description==

The first homegrown BattleMech produced by the Draconis Combine was the Gladiator. The 55-ton 'Mech took seven years to design, as Coordinator Kozo Von Rohrs refused to open up the process to anybody but a select group at New Samarkand Armor Works (the predecessor of Luthien Armor Works) who were under constant surveillance by DEST. 2468 finally saw the GLD-1R Gladiator hit mass-production. Following the Battle of Nox in 2475, the dishonored 'Mech was retired from official production, with NSAW closing down the production lines by 2488. Merryweather Industries was the first private company to attempt BattleMech production without governmental support. Despite their location in the Terran Hegemony, they acquired the plans to the Gladiator and produced a new run in 2490. They were unable to raise the capital to finish their second run, the 4R, and nearly went bankrupt before moving into IndustrialMechs. The GLD-4R production lines were closed down in 2495. A few salvaged Gladiator -1Rs were still in service with militaries across the Inner Sphere and Periphery, though these relics were finally pushed to extinction during the Reunification War. The 55-ton Gladiator has a top speed of 86 km/h, comparable to many other 'Mechs of the same weight. Nine and a half tons of armor provides a respectable amount of protection. Five jump jets enables the 'Mech to jump up to 150 meters at a time.

'''Mechs/GRD-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Grendel features a powerful 315-rated engine, enabling it to move at a fleet 119 km/h, and enough jump jets fixed on the chassis to propel it up to 210 meters at a leap. The Sharks spared no expense in weight-saving materials, making use of an XL Engine, Endo Steel structure, and seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The incredible speed of the Grendel is not terribly helpful in most zellbrigen duels, but it is effective in large-scale actions. The primary configuration uses an ER Large Laser at long range, but really excels at closer ranges. It mounts three ER Medium Lasers that can be devastating to light 'Mechs and a Streak SRM-6 that exploits any holes the lasers make. An ER Small Laser that is effective at point-blank range seems an afterthought. This design is best using its large laser to soften up an opponent, then dash closer in a flurry of lasers and missiles. Two extra double heat sinks help to keep the design mostly cool.

'''Mechs/GRF-SP'''

==Description==

Designed after the personal ‘Mech of Elle Bennett of the 5th Donegal Guards, the GRF-1E 'Sparky' is a radical departure from standard Griffin design ethos. In place of its typical missile rack, the 1E features enough power couplings to mount a cluster of Medium Lasers - five of them, in fact - alongside the typical PPC. In a curious design decision, the engineers behind the Sparky opted for an innovative radiator pattern instead of more sophisticated heat sinks, likely as a cost-saving experiment. While this does give the 'Mech above-average heat dissipation, it's provided complement of standard heat sinks is still woefully inadequate for such a high heat load. This means that, while powerful, this 'Mech needs an equally disciplined pilot to avoid cooking alive.

'''Mechs/GRF-C'''

==Description==

A refit fielded by the Wolf Empire and sold by the Sea Foxes, the Griffin C is a standardised refit package designed to bring captured Inner Sphere Griffins up to Clan spec. Swapping the standard 275 core for a 330 rated one significantly improves the ground speed and allows for the installation of 9 Improved Jump Jets; virtually doubling the mechs jump range. Swamping the standard PPC for a clan spec ER alternative and the LRM rack for a smaller Streak 10 allows the Griffin to strike at almost any range.

This variant of the Griffin was based on the 6S. By dropping one of the ER medium lasers, the Artemis system, and using a Clan-spec LRM-15, engineers found enough room to add a C3 Boosted Slave and a Targeting Computer. CASE II protects the LRM ammunition.

==Description==

Created by a pilot who lost the LRM rack off his Griffin, the -6CV replaces the long-range payload with a mid-range weapon system: a MRM 30. Backing up the MRM rack is an ER PPC with a PPC Capacitor for extra punch. To keep the heat under control, the -6CV mounts double heat sinks and is powered by a Light Fusion Engine for speed. It also has gained a little armor for extra survivability

A variant of the 6S developed in 3067 for the Com Guards only to also fall into hands of the Word of Blake, the 6CS used an Endo Steel frame and was powered by an extralight engine. The 'Mech's primary weapons were an ER PPC and an LRM-15 launcher linked to an Artemis IV fire control system. The 6CS carries two ER medium lasers for short range engagements, and has an advanced electronics warfare suite, consisting of a Guardian ECM Suite and a C3i computer, to allow it to share targeting telemetry with friendly units.

==Description==

The Griffin 3N is a Free Worlds variant designed to improve on the performance of the standard Griffin in almost all aspects of the design. Armed with an ER PPC and an Enhanced LRM-10 with Artemis IV, the Griffin 3N can fight at much longer ranges than would be expected from a standard Griffin. Case II and heavier armour round out the design, making it much more resistant to damage or ammunition explosions.

'''Mechs/GRF-3M'''

==Description==

The 3M Griffin was an upgraded version of the design built for House Marik by Earthwerks and Brigadier Corps starting in 3049. With production lines on Keystone and Oliver this variant sought to enhance the original's long-range capabilities. The engine was exchanged for a Hermes 275 extralight model and carried fourteen double heat sinks to improve heat management. The normal PPC was replaced by a Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC, for longer reach at the expense of more heat, and the LRM launcher had been upgraded to a Doombud LRM-20 launcher, for more indirect fire support capabilities. Finally a ChrisComp Small Laser was mounted in the head and the two tons of LRM reloads in the left torso were protected by CASE. While intended for the Free Worlds League Military the capture of Oliver by FedCom forces meant the 3M also appeared in large numbers in the Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth.

==Description==

Griffin 1Ns use their Jump Jets to stay at range and pelt their opponents from relative safety. 1Ns can run hot if they spend all their time bounding around the battlefield taking potshots, though.

'''Mechs/GRF-1DS'''

==Description==

The 1DS variant of the Griffin, built by Defiance Industries, Kallon Industries and Norse BattleMech Works from their respective production lines starting in 3049, was intended to become the new standard model for the Federated Commonwealth. The engine was upgraded to Hermes 275 extralight engine, fourteen double heat sinks improved cooling and the weapons were stripped from the chassis. The 'Mech now carried a Doombud LRM-20 launcher over the right shoulder and a Thunderbolt-12 Large Pulse Laser in the right arm. It also employed CASE to protect the two tons of missile reloads stored in the left torso. The capture of Norse BattleMech on Marduk by the Draconis Combine meant this variant was also employed by the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery.

'''Mechs/GRM-R'''

==Description==

The Grim Reaper was a 'Mech designed by ComStar to help replenish the heavy material losses suffered by the Com Guards during the Battle of Tukayyid, with the Word of Blake maintaining production after it captured Terra to help rebuild and expand the Word of Blake Militia. Thus the Grim Reaper is seen in moderate numbers in both secular and fanatical militaries. Designed to be a generic trooper 'Mech, the Grim Reaper carries a varied and non specialized weapons payload. This custom Mech was developed by Com Guard Adept Einar Halldórsson and focuses on survivability and using clan tech weaponry.

Aleksandr Hazen: Arguably the Gyrfalcon’s most famous MechWarrior, he was Galaxy Commander of Zeta Galaxy during the Clan's desant into the Republic of the Sphere in 3134. Piloting his 'Mech which he named the White Lily, he would artfully cut through enemy forces in the Republic until reaching Prefecture IX's Capital of Skye. With his sibkin, Galaxy Commander Malvina Hazen, they would nearly take the world through his methods. However, he would be killed in action with Prefect Tara Campbell at the hands of her Hatchetman signature weapon.

==Description==

Clan Jade Falcon developed this medium-weight BattleMech as part of a Clan-wide project in the early 3110s, aiming to revitalize the whole Clan. It replaced some older designs whose parts became increasingly scarce since the loss of home world ties. Conceived by the Clan's Council, it served as its intended purpose not only to act as replacement for older designs, but also bolster the Clan's morale for older warriors and next generation.Among the design's early deployments, it would see action against Clan Hell's Horses in 3113. As part of an effort to show case the 'Mech, the 2nd Falcon Dragoons were sent to Chateau. There the Dragoons conducted a Trial of Possession for a Star of Horse's Balius Quad OmniMech. The Dragoons winning bid consisted entirely of a Star of Gyrfalcons against 30th Mechanized Strike Cluster's Star of Balius. A fight which would pit both Clans’ totem 'Mechs against one another, in this battle the Gyrfalcons would prove its worth to its creators. After the defeat of the Horses, the Dragoon's commander would order the complete destruction of the Balius in front of their former MechWarriors instead of claiming them as their prize.

'''Mechs/CRB-27-H'''

==Description==

Crabs have a reputation for being hard to kill and this CRB-27 chassis has been heavily modified to maximize that natural durability. Massive amounts of Hardened armor cover every component, with Harjel ready to seal any cracks. Most of the weaponry has been moved inboard, out of the more vulnerable arms. This durability comes at the cost of reduced speed and firepower compared to an average Crab.

==Description==

Dismissed by some upon its introduction as little more than a rapidly overheating deathtrap, the HCT-5S is nonetheless one of the most efficient city and close quarters fighting 'mechs ever produced. Its LB-X AC/10 and three Medium Pulse Lasers give it destructive alpha strike potential at close range, and the Hatchetman's natural melee abilities give it a useful fallback when at risk of overheating.

==Description==

Developed by the Draconis Combine, the HCT-5K mounts powerful Pulse Lasers as well as a single ER Medium laser, but most importantly swaps out the crude axe used in gajin variants in favor of a peerless, elegant sword. Perfect for the samurai who seeks a single graceful blow to destroy the enemy in their pursuit of honor and duty.

'''Mechs/HCT-3X'''

==Description==

The Hatchetman -3X further indexes on the stock design's close combat role, adding more armor and replacing its AC10 for an array of SRMs, Lasers, and Anti-Personnel weapons. This is the ultimate melee brawler.

==Description==

Hatchetman 3Fs are the king of the close quarters fight. Packing high impact short range weaponry, and a unique melee Hatchet, any target is in danger when close to the Hatchetman. The Hatchetmans lighter armor requires it to rely on maneuvering and ambushing to stay in the fight.

'''Mechs/HSN-V'''

==Description==

The Hellspawn was designed in response to a call from the Federated Commonwealth for a modern, highly mobile, fire-support BattleMech. The Hellspawn is built on an Endo Steel chassis and a 270 XL engine that gives it a top speed of 97.2 km/h. For protection, the Hellspawn is equipped with a Guardian ECM Suite and has six and a half tons of armor that is barely adequate when compared to other medium 'Mechs. To enhance the 'Mech's mobility it has six jump jets. The 8E is a variant aimed at increasing the 'Mech's long range effectiveness. Two of the Medium Pulse Lasers have been traded for lighter ER Medium Lasers and an Artemis IV system has been added to the LRMs.

==Description==

The Hellspawn was designed in response to a call from the Federated Commonwealth for a modern, highly mobile, fire-support BattleMech. The Hellspawn is built on an Endo Steel chassis and a 270 XL engine that gives it a top speed of 97.2 km/h. For protection, the Hellspawn is equipped with six tons of armor that is barely adequate when compared to other medium 'Mechs. To enhance the 'Mech's mobility it has six Rawlings 80 jump jets that allow the 'Mech to jump up to one hundred and eighty meters. The 9F variant is designed for close combat. The Hellspawn 9F removes both of the LRM-10 launchers and replaces them with more potent, but shorter ranged, MRM-20 launchers giving the 'Mech more punch at the cost of ranged combat capabilities.

==Description==

A favourite of the Davion Light Guards, the 8D transforms the Hellspawn into a close range skirmisher. Retaining the Endo Steel, XL Engine and Guardian ECM of the 7D model, an experimental supercharger and Triple Strength Myomer are added giving the mech a significant edge in close quarters. 3 ER Medium Lasers and a pair of Streak 6's provide a potent punch at close quarters.

'''Mechs/HSN-10G'''

==Description==

The Hellspawn was designed in response to a call from the Federated Commonwealth for a modern, highly mobile, fire-support BattleMech. The Hellspawn is built on an Endo Steel chassis and a 270 XL engine that gives it a top speed of 97.2 km/h. For protection, the Hellspawn is equipped with a Guardian ECM Suite and has six and a half tons of armor that is barely adequate when compared to other medium 'Mechs. To enhance the 'Mech's mobility it has six jump jets. The 8E is a variant aimed at increasing the 'Mech's long range effectiveness. Two of the Medium Pulse Lasers have been traded for lighter ER Medium Lasers and an Artemis IV system has been added to the LRMs.

'''Mechs/HK-1P'''

==Description==

Built by Luthien Armor Works of New Samarkand, the Hitotsume Kozo is a medium BattleMech designed to serve in the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery. This 'Mech's creation was partially influenced by an unofficial cultural rebirth. Keeping this in mind, LAW styled the appearance of the Hitotsume Kozo after the ancient Japanese Bushido armor worn by the samurai warriors during that time period on Terra. It received a poor reception by front-line troops due its advanced features and high heat output; however, it was appreciated when transferred to less-favored combat units, such as Ghost Regiments, as these less-fickle warriors adapted to the design's quirks and turned it into an effective combat unit.

==Description==

The F7, debuting in 3061 is a modification of the F5 that takes advantage of the Hollander II's larger weapons payload to mount the Lyran Alliance's new Heavy Gauss Rifle, which is capable of causing a great deal of damage at short to medium ranges. While improving upon the firepower of the variant, the removal of backup weaponry to fit these massive weapon leaves it with the same problems as the original Hollander.

==Description==

Developed by Arc-Royal MechWorks in the midst of the Jihad, the extensively modified HOP-4X variant utilizes experimental Inner Sphere and Clan technologies. Built on a Composite Internal Structure supplied by Coventry Metal Works, IS grade double heat sinks, CASE and Ferro-Fibrous armor enhance protection and combat ability while an 275 rated Light Fusion Engine boosts the Hoplites speed by 10 km/h. While the body is Inner Sphere tech, the weaponry however is all Clan: the original autocannon and missile launcher combination is replaced by a Clan Rotary AC/5 and Streak LRM-15, supplied with three tons of autocannon ammunition and two tons of Streak missile reloads. A Clan Light Active Probe completes the package.

'''Mechs/HOP-4D'''

==Description==

Conceived by Martinson Armaments of Terra in 2578 as an infantry support 'Mech, the Hoplite first saw service with the newly formed Star League Defense Force during the Reunification War before being relegated to Terran Hegemony militia units in the twenty-seventh century. Intended for infantry support, the Hoplite is slow for a medium 'Mech with a top speed of only 64.8 km/h. However its eleven and a half tons of armor and heavy arsenal, both impressive for a 'Mech of its size, makes the Hoplite a rugged machine able to fight its way out of most situations using superior firepower. Refitted by the Dragoons after the Inner Sphere's recovery of the Helm Memory Core, the HOP-4D Hoplite is armed with an impressive Mydron Excel LB-X Autocannon/10, which allows it to fire either standard rounds or cluster rounds, which are similar to the blast from a shotgun, only on a 'Mech scale. As a secondary weapon, the Hoplite carries a Conan/5 LRM-5 launcher, which also allows it to keep the enemy at long ranges.

'''Mechs/HOP-4C'''

==Description==

Conceived by Martinson Armaments of Terra in 2578 as an infantry support 'Mech, the Hoplite first saw service with the newly formed Star League Defense Force during the Reunification War before being relegated to Terran Hegemony militia units in the twenty-seventh century. Intended for infantry support, the Hoplite is slow for a medium 'Mech with a top speed of only 64.8 km/h. However its eleven and a half tons of armor and heavy arsenal, both impressive for a 'Mech of its size, makes the Hoplite a rugged machine able to fight its way out of most situations using superior firepower. Effectively identical to the original Hoplite, the 4C carries as its primary weapon a Luxor HV Autocannon/10, which allows it to put a good amount of damage on a target, with a low amount of heat. The 'Mech is also armed with a Conan/5 LRM-5 launcher. Arriving with the Wolf's Dragoons, these were the first Hoplites seen in the Inner Sphere since their extinction during the Succession Wars.

'''Mechs/HOP-4BB'''

==Description==

Essentially a Royal variant in everything but name, the Double B Hoplite was put into production at Strana Mechty MechWorks and Eden Weaponry Consolidated just before the death of Aleksandr Kerensky and found its way both into the forces of the Pentagon Powers and the infant toumans of the Clans. Keeping the LRM rack of the 4B, the Double B upgrades the Holly LRM-15 launcher with an Artemis IV system, swaps the PPC for an Kinslaughter H-Class ER PPC, and increases the 'Mech's survivability with a Guardian ECM system, CASE in both torsos, double heat sinks, and an anti-missile system. However, the design's speed and armor were not upgraded, enforcing the need to deploy the 4Bb as a fire-support unit.

==Description==

Conceived by Martinson Armaments of Terra in 2578 as an infantry support 'Mech, the Hoplite first saw service with the newly formed Star League Defense Force during the Reunification War before being relegated to Terran Hegemony militia units in the twenty-seventh century. Intended for infantry support, the Hoplite is slow for a medium 'Mech with a top speed of only 64.8 km/h. However its eleven and a half tons of armor and heavy arsenal, both impressive for a 'Mech of its size, makes the Hoplite a rugged machine able to fight its way out of most situations using superior firepower. The 4B variant of the Hoplite is an early variant of the 'Mech that attempts to both alleviate the ammunition dependence of its primary weapon and increase its long-range damage potential. This is done by mounting a Magna Hellstar PPC as the primary weapon that is backed up by a massive Mitchell Systems LRM-15 launcher with two tons of reloads, giving it excellent long-range and indirect fire support capabilities.

==Description==

During the War of 3039, the 9th Ghost regiment was engaged by the Screaming Eagles mercenary company during the Elidere IV campaign, when they decided to modify two of their Hunchbacks to carry prototype Gauss Rifles. Thus, the HBK-4GG was born, able to cause tremendous damage at ranges beyond anyone's expectations.

The HBK-GI Grid Iron is the Hero variant of the Hunchback. It has the characteristic hunch with quirks that emphasize the Gauss Rifle and Medium Pulse Lasers. It comes from the factory with Double Heat Sinks, Endo-Steel, and an XL engine. Unfortunately, since Gauss Rifles explode like ammo, the XL engine tends to be more of a downside.

'''Mechs/HBK-5S'''

==Description==

Originally a refit line converted to full production, the -5S is a complete overhaul of the Hunchback design developed by Norse-Storm BattleMechs in 3058. The structure has been modified to use Endo Steel construction techniques, the engine has been upgraded to a Light Fusion Engine, and four Jump Jets were added for increased mobility. The 'Mech carries, as its primary weapon, an LB-X Autocannon/20 with CASE-protected ammunition supported by two medium pulse lasers and a single small laser.

'''Mechs/HBK-5N'''

==Description==

A very simple FWLM field upgrade of the lackluster 5M Hunchback introduced in 3057, the 5N model simply downgrades the pulse laser back to a small laser and removes the CASE to carry an extra ton of reloads, retaining the double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/HBK-5M'''

==Description==

Utilizing locally produced components such as the Kali Yama Big Bore autocannon and Hellion-V medium lasers, the Kali Yama-produced 5M Hunchback is a simple upgrade of the original 4G model that first saw production in 3046. The most notable changes saw the heat sinks upgraded to double-strength models, while the small laser was upgraded to a Sunglow Prism-Optic Small Pulse Laser, and CASE was added to protect against ammunition explosions. The extra weight required to add the newer systems forced Kali Yama to reduced ammunition storage to a single ton of reloads, making it unpopular with MechWarriors and spawning the unofficial HBK-5N variant.

'''Mechs/HBK-5J'''

==Description==

A field upgrade kit for the popular 4J model, the 5J is a set of simple upgrades enhancing the effectiveness of the aging design. The addition of double heatsinks enables the removal of 3 heat sinks, whilst still running cooler than the original design. This free weight is used to upgrade the LRM's to the Artemis IV Fire Control system and to replace a pair of medium lasers with pulse variants. The small laser is removed to allow for the addition of CASE , preventing lethal ammo explosions.

'''Mechs/HBK-5E'''

==Description==

Debuting in 3063, the 5E is a Word of Blake designed upgrade to the older 4E design. Intended for deployment with Protectorate Militia units and Free Worlds League formations, the Blakists sought to rebuild the design with newer technology and correct some of the flaws apparent in the older design. Installing a new Light Fusion Engine and Endo Steel enabled the designers to swap the Thumper for the much larger and more powerful Sniper Artillery Canon. Defensively the design mounts CASE to protect against the ammunition explosions that plagued the older 4E model. A swap to ER Lasers and DHS round out the design, giving it increased range and striking power. Popular with Hunchback pilots and Artillery units, the design is slated for continuous production; with Kali Yama having to expand their Hunchback line to keep up with demand.

'''Mechs/HBK-5A'''

==Description==

Developed during the Clan Invasion, the 5A takes advantage of the newly reintroduced Arrow IV and an Artemis IV FCS. Intended to operate in support of a lance or as part of a dedicated battery, the 5A carries a mix of homing missiles and utility ammo; enabling it to bombard targets that have been tagged by supporting forces or deploying FASCAM and other speciality ammo as and when needed. Guardian ECM confuses and blinds enemy sensors, vastly reducing the chances of accurate counter battery fire, whilst the use of CASE protects against catastrophic ammunition explosions. Sold to any interested buyer as part of Kali Yama’s contribution to the war effort, the design has been seen all across the Inner Sphere and is increasingly found in the Periphery, where reliable and cheap Artillery assets are in high demand.

The 4SP variant of the Hunchback replaces the Autocannon with two SRM6 launchers. This has the potential of doing more damage than the standard model, though the damage is more spread out.  This firepower is supplemented by two Medium Lasers in each arm.

'''Mechs/HBK-4P'''

==Description==

The 4P version of the Hunchback trades the singular impact of a massive Autocannon for a frightening array of lighter Energy weaponry that is actually capable of dealing more damage overall. This all comes at the cost of greatly increased heat buildup, of course.

Modified to aid with indirect fire support as well as being able to act as a guardian for fire support lances, the HBK-4J succeeds at both roles.  With its twin LRM-10s it can contribute to the barrage, whilest its five Medium Lasers allow it to fend off the Light 'Mechs that tend to harass fire support teams.

'''Mechs/HBK-4GB'''

==Description==

The Royal successor to the standard 4G, the 4Gb was built around an XL Engine and an Endosteel skeleton. The weight freed up is put towards an enlarged AC/20 magazine, with incorporated CASE, allowing it to carry double the usual ammunition load and survive an internal ammo explosion. Double Heat Sinks enable the secondary lasers to be swapped out for Pulse versions, whilst an AMS system reduces the threat of long range missile attacks. A Beagle Active Probe rounds out the package, improving it’s effectiveness as a close in Urban fighter and as a body guard mech; roles in which the normal Hunchback already excelled.

'''Mechs/HBK-4E'''

==Description==

Designed by the Explorer Corps to provide heavy fire support in environments unsuited to a normal tank or support unit, the 4E is a field refit that mounts a Thumper Artillery piece in place of the standard AC/20. Removing a mostly superfluous s heat sink, frees up the weight for the 4E retain it’s secondary weaponry should it be engaged by head hunter units. By 3010, the Explorer Corps had entered into a long term contract with Kali Yama Weapons to produce limited numbers of this design under licence. The design spread to other interested parties, after the Corps relaxed their licensing arrangements, following the Scarlet Fist debacle; in which the a lone Corps pilot – Larissa ‘‘Raza’’ Brooks – managed to successfully evaded the pirate band responsible for the destruction of her lance, before stalking them back to their base and levelling it with repeated Thumper volleys in the middle of the night.

==Description==

The Hunchback IIC is a ClanTech refit of the venerable Hunchback. Its meager armor, coupled with paltry ammunition and lack of long-range weapons, led Inner Sphere observers to conclude that this 'Mech was a last-ditch effort for failed warriors to die with glory. In truth, the assignment of a Hunchback IIC was essentially a death sentence. Warriors given this machine were not expected to survive their next battle.

==Description==

The primary configuration of the Huntsman sports a myriad of weapons. An Ultra Autocannon/2 and Artemis IV-linked LRM-10 provide long-range capability, while four ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-6 make it a vicious close range 'Mech. A pair of Anti-Personnel Pods and a Flamer protect it from conventional infantry, and an Anti-Missile System provides it with some defense against incoming missiles. An Active Probe finds hidden units, and a TAG spotting laser can designate targets for homing artillery strikes.

'''Mechs/HUR-WO-TC'''

==Description==

A rivalry between two lesser Solaris stables beget the prototype Huron Warrior nicknamed the ’Thunderchief.’ While the original was made almost entirely from, illegibly, stolen parts; the few knock-offs and reproductions that have filtered throughout the Inner Sphere have solidified this unusual design. The Thunderchief is primarily built around a Thumper Artillery cannon which used to pummel targets at range and a hatchet used for in-close work.

'''Mechs/HUR-WO-R4N'''

==Description==

The R4N is a 3063 modification that looks to the original design of the Huron Warrior and reverts the 'Mech back to its original fire support role. This is done by stripping the 'Mechs weapons and ammunition payload and replacing them with a pair of LRM-15 launchers and four Medium Lasers. The 'Mech is also armored with new Stealth Armor and carries a Guardian ECM Suite. This combination of LRM-15s and Stealth Armor makes the R4N an incredibly powerful fire support 'Mech.

'''Mechs/HUR-WO-R4L'''

==Description==

The primary weapon that the Huron Warrior carries is a Grizzard Gauss Rifle (Modified 210 Version) that is capable of stripping off a ton of armor with each shot at extremely long ranges. The Gauss Rifle is backed up by a Martell ER Large Laser that provides good supplemental firepower at long ranges. Finally, it is armed with a Martell Medium Pulse Laser, which gives the Huron Warrior the ability to protect itself at short ranges.

==Description==

The original prototype Icarus was developed at the Happen Military Reservation on Xanthe III in 2466, and was first deployed on Alula Australis in 2469. Its premiere date in official documents is listed as 2470. The prototype used primitive equipment and lacked jump jets. It had a Large Laser to complement the Small Laser. Two SRM-2s and twin Machine Guns could prove devastating to conventional troops. Only six of these were ever produced and they are all long gone. The primitive engine drove it to a maximum of 64 km/h. Ten and a half tons of Primitive Armor provided protection.

'''Mechs/KTO-K'''

==Description==

An upgrade to the KTO-C, the KTO-K removed the Large Laser and LRM launcher to upgrade the short-range missiles to Streak SRM-6s. The lasers were upgraded to ER Medium Lasers and a third was added. The most significant difference was the addition of Jump jets to allow the unit to leap up to 150 meters.

'''Mechs/KTO-21'''

==Description==

Developed by both ComStar and the Word of Blake, the KTO-21 was the first 'Mech to utilize both the new Improved Narc Missile Beacon (iNarc for short) and the improved C3 computer system. In order to utilize these new systems, the KTO-21 was refitted with an Endo Steel chassis and carried half a ton less armor than the KTO-19. Retaining only the two SRM launchers, the LRM launcher was dropped and the standard medium lasers were upgraded to more advanced ER Medium Lasers, enhanced by a switch to Double Heat Sinks.

'''Mechs/KTO-20'''

==Description==

The KTO-20, used to good effect in the War of 3039, was the slightly downgraded version of the KTO-19 given to the Draconis Combine by ComStar as part of Operation Rosebud. The KTO-20 was nearly identical to its Star League era cousin, the only real difference being the loss of the Narc Missile beacon in exchange for a Magna Mk III Large Laser. It was equipped with double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/KIM-2A'''

==Description==

The Komodo was designed in 3053 to hunt and kill Clan Elemental Battle Armor. The 'Mech is built to be able to catch up to and destroy them with exceptional speed and maneuverability. The 'Mech is powered by a VOX 225 XL Engine that propels the 'Mech to a maximum speed of 86.4 kph. The Komodo can jump up to one hundred and fifty meters allowing it to traverse just about any terrain with ease, and is armored with seven and a half tons of armor. The 'Mech is also equipped with a Matabushi Guardian ECM Suite to defend against any enemy electronic warfare systems and also a Forward-1 TAG allowing the Komodo to designate a target for an Arrow IV artillery strike.

'''Mechs/KW2-LHW'''

==Description==

The Lineholder was the first BattleMech design to come from Kressly Warworks. The Lineholder is designed around a set of `Common Sense Rules` for 'Mech design. This approach has produced a 'Mech with a good ground speed and respectable amount of armor and firepower. The 'Mech has a top speed of 86.4 km/h, allowing it to keep up with all but the fastest light and medium 'Mechs. The Lineholder also carries ten tons of armor protection and has fourteen heat sinks. Its mix of off-the-shelf weapons and equipment makes the Lineholder a reliable 'Mech that is easy to repair and is dependable in battle. However, the ultimate selling point for the Lineholder, especially to its target audience of small units and minor nobles, is value and price. In the first year of sales, the Lineholder was historically successful compared with other 55-ton BattleMechs. For minor factions able to afford brand new BattleMechs, the Lineholder has become the garrison machine of choice.

Intended for sale to both Inner Sphere and Clan customers, it has been shunned by the Clans save for the Nova Cats and Exiled Wolves as '...an outrage against everything Nicholas Kerensky stood for and taught us.' However, it has proven popular with the Successor States.

'''Mechs/MCIII-X'''

==Description==

With the success of the Mad Cat Mk II design Clan Diamond Shark developed the Mad Cat III as a medium 'Mech to accompany the heavy Mad Cat and assault Mad Cat II. Intended for sale to both Inner Sphere and Clan customers, it has been shunned by the Clans save for the Nova Cats and Exiled Wolves as '...an outrage against everything Nicholas Kerensky stood for and taught us.' However, it has proven popular with the Successor States.

==Description==

When the Treaty of Taurus was signed, it established the New Colony Region in co-operation between the Magistracy of Canopus and the Taurian Concordat and also created the Colonial Marshals. This is a Magistracy of Canopus variant of the Marshal, that was developed during the Jihad. This model saw introduction of a Light Fusion Engine, and some modern weaponry to the Marshal's arsenal. Right Torso's Medium Pulse Laser is retained, while a Light PPC, Plasma Rifle, and a MML-9 is introduced for ranged attacks. For dedicated anti-infantry work, the Machine Guns are exchanged for pair of Light Machine Guns in a Machine Gun Array.

Regarded by some as a survivable alternative to the Hunchback IIC, the Medusa 3 packs an incredible close-range punch while still keeping the speed, manueverability, and armor of the previous designs. The Medusa 3 hosts a massive Ultra Autocannon 20 on its right torso supplemented by an ER Medium Laser in each arm. In order to capitalize on any weaknesses in enemy armor, this variant retains an SRM-6 in the center torso.

==Description==

Developed only a year after the original, the Medusa 2 variant is a logical companion to the Medusa 1. Unlike many fire-support designs, this variant relies on the speed and manueverability provided by its 300XL engine and six jump jets to keep pace with the Medusa-1. The Medusa 2 fields three LRM-10s and a pair of ER Medium Lasers in each arm.

'''Mechs/MS1-OG'''

==Description==

Named for the door guards who serve to ward off evil spirits from a home, the Men Shen is the first OmniMech to come from the Capellan Confederation, it borrows heavily from the Raven BattleMech for its basic design concept. The 'Mech is built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a vulnerable but light VOX 330 XL Engine that gives it a top speed of 97.2 km/h that is augmented by MASC system allowing the 'Mech to be pushed up to 129.6 km/h in short bursts. The Men Shen comes with eleven tons of armor, giving it a respectable amount of protection. The Men Shen carries on its base chassis a Beagle Active Probe allowing it to serve in a recon role regardless of its configuration. For weapons and equipment the Men Shen has seventeen tons of free pod space.

'''Mechs/OSP-36'''

==Description==

Developed in 3139, the OSP-36 was the first non-prototype Advanced Point Defense System-equipped BattleMech introduced by the Republic Armed Forces. To mount a APDS system and a ton of ammo in each arm, the OSP-36 drops the Beagle probe and ER Small Laser entirely, replacing the Gauss Rifle with an ER PPC supported by a Radical Heat Sink System to free up the required weight while allowing the variant to remain combat-effective.

==Description==

A customized variant created in 3085 for Lawrence Sawyer of the Lamenkov's Liability, only the MML-7 and Beagle were kept, with the rest of the weaponry replaced with a Heavy PPC, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and a C3 Slave. For improved cross-country handling it also mounted five Improved Jump Jets. A Compact Gyro was also installed.

'''Mechs/OSP-26'''

==Description==

Designed as a medium weight fire support unit, the Osprey OSP-15 was a casualty of the Succession Wars. Revived by the Word of Blake in 3074, the design would evolve to become the OSP-26, debuting in 3076. Armed with an M7 Gauss Rifle and an MML-7 for long range combat, the OSP-26 carries a pair of ER Medium Lasers and an ER Small for close range combat. The Gauss Rifle and MML-7 are each supplied by 2 tons of ammunition, stored in CASE protected magazines. A Beagle Probe allows the mech to function in a scout role, sniffing out hidden opponents . Built around a 220 rated XL Engine and an Endo Steel chassis, the OSP-26 mounts 11 tons of armour and 4 Jump Jets; and 10 double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/PXH-3S'''

==Description==

The 3S model of this 'Mech, first deployed in 3042, was another upgrade using rediscovered technology that attempted to make the Phoenix Hawk even more effective for reconnaissance. The engine was upgraded to an ExtraLight version and ten double heat sinks improved heat management. The overall armor protection was increased by one ton and replaced with Lexington Ltd. High Grade Ferro-Fibrous armor. The primary weapon on the 'Mech was a Thunderbolt-12 Large Pulse Laser built into the right arm, though it still retained the two medium lasers and machine guns of the original. Additionally an anti-missile system was mounted on the right arm, with its two tons of ammo (along with two tons of machine gun ammo) protected by CASE in the left torso. Its primary difference from other variants introduced during the time period was the addition of a MASC system, which allowed the 'Mech to reach speeds of up to 129.6 in short bursts.

'''Mechs/PXH-3M'''

==Description==

The 3M variant of the 'Mech was also introduced in 3048, built by Earthwerks Incorporated from their Keystone factory and using upgrades based on rediscovered Star League technology. First, the internal structure of the 'Mech has been redesigned to utilize a 1A Type7 Endo Steel chassis. The engine was then replaced with a GM 270 XL and the heat sinks were upgraded to double heat sinks. This allowed the weapons payload to be changed extensively, with all of the original weapons being stripped from the chassis. In their place the 'Mech carried two Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Lasers as its primary weapons and two Martell Medium Pulse Lasers for close in work, with one of each mounted in either arm. Finally, a MainFire Point Defense Anti-Missile System replaced the right-arm machine gun, with two tons of both AMS and machine gun reloads carried in the CASE-protected left torso. The electronic systems were also replaced with an Achernar Electronics HID-8 comm system and Federated Hunter target-tracking system.

'''Mechs/PXH-3K'''

==Description==

The 3K Phoenix Hawk was another upgrade of the design that used rediscovered technologies, built by Alshain Weapons and GKT Enterprises for House Kurita and the Free Rasalhague Republicrespectively. Introduced in 3050, the engine was upgraded to an XL model, with the saved weight used to upgrade the weapons payload on the 'Mech, taking its cues from the 1K variant. Like the PXH-3D model the 3K carries carries two ER large lasers and two medium Lasers. It also carried twelve double heat sinks to manage the additional waste heat, and the eight tons of standard armor were replaced with the same amount of New Samarkand Royal Ferro-Fibrous armor, improving its survivability.

'''Mechs/PXH-3D'''

==Description==

The 3D variant of this 'Mech was introduced in 3048, based on the 1D used by Davion forces. It was built out of New Avalon by Archenar BattleMechs as one of a slew of redesigns using recovered lostech. The 'Mech utilized Endo Steel construction techniques and a Extra-Light engine to free up weight and space for a number of improvements, particularly its weaponry. The 'Mech carried a pair of ER Large Lasers and a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers split between both arms. With the machine guns and their ammunition removed, this allowed two additional heat sinks to be added, and all single heat sinks were exchanged for double strength models.

'''Mechs/PXH-2L'''

==Description==

The Phoenix Hawk 2L was one of the first new mechs to be produced under the Long Road initiative. A compete overhaul designed to be compatible with the myriad PXH-1 variants found throughout the Periphery, the redesign takes advantage of Lushan Industries production license for the new ER Large Laser. Mounting this in place of the original Large Laser, the weapons increased heat is balanced by the inclusion of 2 extra heat sinks; with an Endo steel chassis providing the necessary free wieght. Retaining the medium lasers and the Guardian ECM suite, the 2L is a cheap upgrade for anyone fielding a PXH-1 design. Available for export throughout the Periphery, the only constraint to production is the lack of a production facility for the PXH chassis, though Alliance Mech Works has plans to build a dedicated PHX line should the design prove popular. Until then the current output is limited to in-situ conversions of existing mechs and the restoration of battlefield salvage.

'''Mechs/PXH-1K'''

==Description==

The 1K variant was particularly favored by House Kurita, though when it was introduced in 2603 it represented a departure from the traditional thinking of the Phoenix Hawk. By removing all jump jets from the 'Mech, room is freed up to install three additional heat sinks and another one and a half tons of armor. The machine guns and ammunition have also been removed from the design and replaced with a single Small Laser carried in the center torso.

'''Mechs/PXH-1GS'''

==Description==

After the destruction of their main production line in 2928, Solaris 7 based Blue Shot Weapons looked for other means of income. They took the idea behind the STR-3G Stinger variant and created a similar variant of the Phoenix Hawk by adding a second Large Laser in the left arm. To free up the necessary weight the PXH-1GS removes the Medium Lasers and Machine Guns and sacrifices some speed & maneuverability, but also adds 3 Heat Sinks and two Small Lasers. Both the primary lasers are mounted in gunpods giving the variant its "Gunslinger" nickname.

'''Mechs/PXH-1D'''

==Description==

The 1D variant of the Phoenix Hawk was commonly used by the forces of House Davion. Introduced in 2856, it removes both of the machine guns and the ammunition and replaces them with two additional heat sinks. While removing a small amount of the 'Mech's short-range firepower and a powerful set of weapons against infantry, the additional heat sinks made the 1D's heat load more manageable.

'''Mechs/PXH-1'''

==Description==

First introduced by the Terran Hegemony in 2568, the Phoenix Hawk was one of the most well known BattleMechs in the Inner Sphere. The 'Mech began life when Orguss Industries realized that it could reinforce the Stinger chassis to create a larger version, one with the same speed and maneuverability as the Stinger but with superior armor, firepower and electronics. Though not without its own drawbacks, the Phoenix Hawk quickly became the standard by which all other reconnaissance 'Mechs were measured.

'''Mechs/PHX-HK2'''

==Description==

The Phoenix Hawk LAM was the largest Land-Air 'Mech produced during the Star League. Allied Aerospace reworked their designs for conversion equipment and the size of the LAM, learning from their mistake with the Shadow Hawk LAM and the success of the Stinger LAM. The resulting LAM was the largest LAM ever constructed capable of remaining in AirMech mode. Unfortunately, large Land-Air 'Mech conversion technology was not fully researched before the fall of the Star League, and the Phoenix Hawk LAM frequently met its end due to the occasional glitch. The end of the Star League and destruction of the Allied Aerospace facilities at the beginning of the First Succession War prevented further development and refinement.

'''Mechs/PHX-HK1R'''

==Description==

This version was created before the introduction of the PHX-HK2, in 2695. It removed the ER Large Laser, a Medium Laser, and two heat sinks, replacing them with an experimental Snub-Nose PPC, Beagle Active Probe, and an additional half ton of armor.

'''Mechs/PHX-HK1'''

==Description==

Developed for the Star League Defense Force Royal Divisions in 2692, this variant of the Phoenix Hawk LAM used four Medium Lasers and a single ER Large Laser as its main firepower. Twelve double heat sinks kept the heat curve low, but the limited fuel, armor, and maneuverability made the Phoenix Hawk LAM easy prey for AeroSpace Fighters of the same weight. It could maneuver fast enough to evade heavier foes however

'''Mechs/PCR-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Pouncer was originally a test bed design that was upgraded to combat specifications on the orders of then-IlKhan Ulric Kerensky, as it was realized that a more mobile 'Mech was needed when combating Inner Sphere forces. The Pouncer is built on a lightweight DSAM Endo 4 Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a 240 XL engine which gives it a maximum speed of 97.2 km/h. The 'Mech's mobility is enhanced with five Grandthrust Mk. Four jump jets that allow it to jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Pouncer has a respectable six tons of Forging ZM15 Ferro-Fibrous armor. Overall, the Pouncer is an excellent OmniMech with fifteen and a half tons of pod space, allowing it to carry a wide variety of weapons payloads.

'''Mechs/RB-P'''

==Description==

The Rabid Coyote was designed by scientists from Clan Coyote to be a complement to other, slower BattleMechs. First deployed in 3066, the 'Mech was deployed in an effort to stave off the slow decline of the previous decades that had befallen the Clan that created the OmniMech. With an eye towards cost, the Rabid Coyote employs a standard fusion engine, though it does make use of an Endo Steel internal structure and eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Curiously, as the 'Mech is intended to be a bodyguard for larger 'Mechs like the Savage Coyote, front-line warriors spurn the design because they do not wish to be seen merely as ''support''.

'''Mechs/RVN-5X'''

==Description==

The next generation of the Capellan Confederation's iconic Raven scout BattleMech, the main difference between the Raven II and the original Raven is that this new 'Mech seems to be meant for scout hunting and breaking through enemy lines, as opposed to the latter's fire support role. These new roles are played with the use of a Firmir Hypnos Tight-Stream Electromagnetic Pulse Cannon mounted in the 'Mech's left arm.

'''Mechs/RFL-1N'''

==Description==

The first production version of the Rifleman weighed fifty tons and used primitive technology. Each arm carried a single large laser and medium laser. It was protected by eleven and a half tons of Primitive Armor and used a Primitive Engine to reach a top speed of 64km/h. Though it served in the Reunification War, this version of the Rifleman was usually used by militia and second line forces thereafter.

'''Mechs/UCU-F4R'''

==Description==

This variant went by the unfortunate nickname Hobbled Scarecrow - it was an attempt to produce a version of the Scarecrow that could serve more ably in combat against other BattleMechs, although thin armor and limited speed made the Scarecrow a poor choice for such battles even with the revised weapons loadout. The Hobbled Scarecrow lacked the Machine Gun Arrays of the original and the Chameleon Light Polarization Shield, mounting three Medium Lasers instead, one located in each arm and one in the right torso.

==Description==

The Scarecrow is a rare BattleMech that Corean Enterprises produced from their plant on Augusta, although the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns officially disavowed knowledge of the Scarecrow until the 3140s. Incorporating mixed Clan and Inner Sphere technology, the Scarecrow was designed to be very effective at killing its intended target - infantry.

==Description==

The Sentinel is a medium BattleMech built by Defiance Industries, originally under exclusive contract for the Lyran Commonwealth, as an infantry support and installation defense 'Mech. While initially pleased to have a then Terran Hegemony controlled factory manufacturing the 'Mech exclusively for the LCAF, the Lyrans were less so when a Star League Council amendment in 2652 permitted the Star League Defense Force to purchase a highly advanced version of the design which Houses Steiner, Marik and Davion would not receive until years later. The Sentinel was one of many designs to suffer from the technological decline of the Succession Wars era, with Defiance first losing the ability to manufacture its advanced weapon systems before discontinuing production entirely in 3014 due to lack of both parts and interest. Rather than disappear from the battlefield, the Sentinel now began to appear in increasing numbers thanks to ComStar and its massive stockpile of SLDF material, both providing the design to the Draconis Combine prior to the War of 3039 and using it to help outfit its Com Guards.

==Description==

The Sentinel is a medium BattleMech built by Defiance Industries, originally under exclusive contract for the Lyran Commonwealth, as an infantry support and installation defense 'Mech. While initially pleased to have a then Terran Hegemony controlled factory manufacturing the 'Mech exclusively for the LCAF, the Lyrans were less so when a Star League Council amendment in 2652 permitted the Star League Defense Force to purchase a highly advanced version of the design which Houses Steiner, Marik and Davion would not receive until years later. The Sentinel was one of many designs to suffer from the technological decline of the Succession Wars era, with Defiance first losing the ability to manufacture its advanced weapon systems before discontinuing production entirely in 3014 due to lack of both parts and interest. Rather than disappear from the battlefield, the Sentinel now began to appear in increasing numbers thanks to ComStar and its massive stockpile of SLDF material, both providing the design to the Draconis Combine prior to the War of 3039 and using it to help outfit its Com Guards.

'''Mechs/SNT-W5'''

==Description==

The Sentry was developed under pressure from the Draconis and Capellan marches for a more advanced 'Mech to defend the borders of the Federated Suns. The 'Mech is built on a light weight Dorwinion hyperactive 3 Endo Steel chassis. This chassis saves weight, allowing the 'Mech to carry heavier weapons and equipment. The Sentry is powered by a Nissan 200 fusion engine that gives it a top speed of 86.4 km/h that is augmented by five HildCo Model 12 jump jets that make it possible for the Sentry to jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. To compensate for its less than average mobility, the Sentry has an impressive eight and a half tons of Starshield A armor that has been fitted with CASE to protect the 'Mech from an ammunition explosion.

==Description==

This configuration is apparently intended for space operations. Each arm carries an Arc Welder, a Medium Pulse Laser and an ER Medium Laser. Two ER Small Lasers are in the right and left torso, while a single ER PPC is installed in the left torso. Seven Improved Jump Jets and a series of Articulated Jump Jets provide mobility in the depths of space, with two tons of Liquid Storage that doubles as a Cooling Pod for increased stability. To maintain grip on spacecraft, the Septimecia US has talons on each leg.

'''Mechs/SPT-PRIME'''

==Description==

A utilitarian medium-class workhorse, the Septicemeia is intently devoid of the more experimental technology utilised by the Cephalus and Osteon. Designed for mass production, the Septicemia uses a combination of an XL Engine, Endo Steel chassis, and nine tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor in order to mount 28 tons of weapons. The prime configuration is a long-range combatant with a HAG 40 and an ER Large Laser mounted in opposing torsos. A targeting computer improves the weapons accuracy.

One of the rarer configurations, the Septicemia E consists of a pair of ER PPCs and six ER Medium Lasers tied into a Targeting Computer. It also carries a Light TAG to locate hidden units, but the most dangerous part of its equipment is the Nova CEWS system that allowed it to share targeting data with friendly units.

'''Mechs/SPT-D'''

==Description==

A hard-hitting, command variant, the 'D' was the least-commonly fielded of all the ones seen on Babylon. It mounts an ER PPC for distance. An Ultra Autocannon/20 can make short work of enemies up close, though ammunition is limited. Three ER Small Lasers are potent backups for the high-heat ER PPC. Jump jets enable the 'D' to vault up to 150 meters at a time. Accuracy of all the weapons is aided by a Targeting Computer.

'''Mechs/SPT-B'''

==Description==

The B configuration excels at close-quarters combat in restricted terrain, such as an urban environment. Seven improved jump jets enable the Septicemia to leap up to 210 meters in the air. Two Large Pulse Lasers and three Small Pulse Lasers allow the MechWarrior to make full use of the 'Mech's jumping capabilities and still be accurate. Additional heat sinks keep heat levels under control.

==Description==

Based upon the good old Shadow Hawk 2H, the Valkyrja, 'Chooser of the Slain' in old Terran Norse, is specifically designed to support less than legitimate Active Shield and Vibro-Dagger. Additionally the Cockpit system is jury-rigged to support an 'ECM' that just sends Heavy Metal over all standard frequencies...

'''Mechs/SHD-SX'''

==Description==

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer

'''Mechs/SHD-5MI'''

==Description==

Created by Maverick Industries, the 5MI is a redesign of House Marik’s 5M model. Designed to compete with the Griffin 1DS and other new designs, the 5MI was Mavericks attempt to win over the recalcitrant FedCom military. Focusing on improving survivability and battlefield endurance, the 5MI used new technology like DHS and an Artemis IV FSC to give it an edge. Unfortunately the design was deemed to expensive too produce and as a result the military declined to purchase any of the initial production run. Such poor performance led to the second manufacturing run being cancelled and resources diverted to more promising lines. The surviving models were sold off to various mercenary groups, though the Maverick Industries scion would use one during her time in the 10th Lyran Guards; netting the company the occasional conversion or custom order from fellow members of the regiment.

'''Mechs/SHD-5M'''

==Description==

The 5M Shadow Hawk is the first complete overhaul and upgrade of the design, unveiled in 3048 by Earthwerks for the Free Worlds League. The chassis has been upgraded to an Earthwerks SHD II Endo Steel frame, an additional ton of armor was added, two additional jump jets were fitted for a total jumping distance of 150 meters, the engine replaced with an extralight version of the Hermes 275, and the weapons load has undergone an almost complete renovation. The original autocannon has been updated to an Imperator Ultra Autocannon/5, the LRM launcher to a Doombud LRM-20, and the head-mounted SRM launcher to a Hovertec Streak SRM-2. The amount of ammunition carried and the left-arm medium laser are maintained, and while the number of heat sinks was reduced to ten these were upgrade to double-strength models.

The Shadow Hawk 2Ki was conceived during the First Succession War by the Draconis Combine in 2803. As the enraged Federated Suns pushed the Kuritan troops back, the Draconis Combine dramatically overhauled the chassis by replacing almost all of its original armaments, most notably swapping in an upgraded PPC in place of an Autocannon.

==Description==

The Shadow Hawk 2H is the perfect example of a 'jack-of-all-trades.' It supports weaponry for all ranges, has respectable speed and jump capability, and mounts decent armor. This comes at the cost of excelling at nothing in particular.

==Description==

The Shadow Hawk 2D is an interesting model. Its default payload sacrifices a lot of armor to mount a bit more firepower, though some argue the tradeoff isn't worth it. Its Alpha Strikes <i>are</i> better, though, soÔÇª I guess you can be the judge.

==Description==

First introduced in 2467, this first generation of the Shadow Hawk employs early BattleMech technology in its weaponry, equipment and its armor. This design was first produced by Lang Industries on Caph, where it was designed as part of the Hegemony's efforts to keep ahead of the Inner Sphere's newly stolen BattleMech technology.

'''Mechs/SHD-X2'''

==Description==

Allied Aerospace won the SLDF's contract to produce a series of Land-Air mechs with a design based on the venerable Shadow HawkBattleMech. Allied gave their new Land-Air 'Mech the ability to convert directly into an Aerospace Fighter. While construction was completed in 2680, thanks to the chassis' numerous flaws, lackluster performance and a number of ill-fated and publicly witnessed test-flights disasters during SLDF reviews in 2682, Allied Aerospace was forced to go back to the drawing board. The more refined X2 variant faced considerable scrutiny by SLDF evaluators in 2684, successfully meeting the SLDF's requirements but still rejected thanks to its high fuel consumption and the bad press generated by the earlier X1. Twenty SHD-X2 were built for trials with potential customers, but failed to attract any interest. Ultimately Allied scrapped the Shadow Hawk LAM program in favor of what became the considerably more successful Phoenix Hawk LAM.

'''Mechs/SHD-X1'''

==Description==

The original and considerably flawed prototypes were completed in 2680. Based on the Shadow Hawk SHD-2H, the 'Mech carried a Class 2 Autocannon in place of the Class 5. The SHD-X1 carried only 6.5 tons of armor for protection. Only one chassis survived multiple crashes caused by its faulty schematics. It had a top ground speed of 86.4 km/h like its progenitor, the SHD-2H, and used ten single heat sinks.

With the success of the latest generation of Mad Cats and Vultures, it’s only logical that other beloved OmniMechs get their due. Dubbed the Ryoken III, this beast seems an odd choice for the Wolves over one of their homegrown designs, and suggests a possible Snow Raven link.

==Description==

The Snake is a 'Mech that was built under the aegis of an Elemental hunter. With the power of hindsight though the Snake is clearly designed to hunt Inner Sphere Battle Armor suits. The 'Mech is built using a Vox 225 XL Engine to move at a top speed of 86.4 kph. The Snake also has a jumping capability of one hundred and fifty meters making it capable of outmaneuvering any battle armor suit and also keeping it on par with most medium 'Mechs. The Snake is also armored with seven tons of armor and uses double heat sinks to cool the 'Mech's excess heat.

'''Mechs/SNK-2BR'''

==Description==

The Snake is a 'Mech that was built under the aegis of an Elemental hunter. With the power of hindsight though the Snake is clearly designed to hunt Inner Sphere Battle Armor suits. The 'Mech is built using a Vox 225 XL Engine to move at a top speed of 86.4 kph. The Snake also has a jumping capability of one hundred and fifty meters making it capable of outmaneuvering any battle armor suit and also keeping it on par with most medium 'Mechs. The Snake is also armored with seven tons of armor and uses double heat sinks to cool the 'Mech's excess heat.

'''Mechs/ST-14G'''

==Description==

The Stag was built on an Endo Steel frame and powered by an XL Engine. Ten tons of armor provided the 'Mech with the maximum possible protection. The long-range threat from the cavalry 'Mech comes from one ER Large Laser. At close range it is supplemented by paired Medium Lasers and SRM-4s. Two, CASE-protected tons of ammunition gives MechWarriors the flexibility to use different types of munitions, making the Stag a threat to a variety of units. Twelve double heat sinks handles all of the heat generated by the weapons.

'''Mechs/ST-24G'''

==Description==

The so-called Stag II incorporated a prototype version of the ER PPC that was roughly comparable to the Clan version of the weapon, though it was slightly less destructive. This upgrade of the large laser necessitated removal of the MASC, though the top speed was upgraded to 119 km/h. Additionally, Ferro-Fibrous weave was incorporated into the armor, though at an overall decrease in protection. The SRMs were removed in favor of an additional Medium Laser, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and two Small Lasers.[2] This gave the 'Mech greater battlefield longevity, though the potential for excessive heat buildup was much greater.

==Description==

The Stealth is a heavy scout 'Mech that is in use by the Federated Suns and the Lyran Alliance. The 'Mech has a GM 315 XL Engine that allows the Stealth to move at speeds of 118.8 kph and the MASC system on board can push the 'Mech to 151.2 kph in short bursts. This amazing mobility is augmented by jump jets which the Stealth can use to jump up to two hundred and ten meters. The Stealth is also outfitted with a Cyclops-Beagle Sensory Active Probe that the Stealth can use to find hidden enemy units.

'''Mechs/STH-2D1'''

==Description==

The Stealth is a heavy scout 'Mech that is in use by the Federated Suns and the Lyran Alliance. The 'Mech has a GM 315 XL Engine that allows the Stealth to move at speeds of 118.8 kph and the MASC system on board can push the 'Mech to 151.2 kph in short bursts. This amazing mobility is augmented by jump jets which the Stealth can use to jump up to two hundred and ten meters. The Stealth is also outfitted with a Cyclops-Beagle Sensory Active Probe that the Stealth can use to find hidden enemy units.

'''Mechs/SWD-P'''

==Description==

The Swordsman was an early Federated Suns medium-class BattleMech which was originally built in 2463 as House Davion's third in-house BattleMech design. The design was tainted by heavy use in the Davion Civil War of 2525-2540. Eventually, production ended and the design was relegated to the dustbin of history. However, in the 3060s, the mech was put back into production by House Davion to supplement their forces in the FedCom Civil War. The SWD-2 is the stock production design, mounting heavy armor and firepower for the tonnage: 7.5 tons of armor and a grab-bag mix of guns including an AC/5, LRM-5, SRM-4, two Medium Lasers, and a Small Laser.

'''Mechs/TLS-HB'''

==Description==

With the reintroduction of Helm Core LosTech, the Taurian Defense Force found themselves lagging behind their neighbours. Just as they did during the Age of War, the Taurians turned to the home grown Talos. With a reputation as an easy to maintain and easy to manufacture mech, the design was just what the TDF needed. Lacking the resources to turn the newly redesigned Talos into a viable production model, the Taurians enlisted the aid of their neighbours, in exchange for joining the ongoing Trinity Alliance negotiations. Aided by the expertise of Capellan engineers and financial investment from the Magistracy of Canopus, Vandenburg started limited manufacturing of the Talos; at their New Vandenburg plant: in late 3059. The formal signing of the Trinity Alliance, in 3062; awarded production licenses to both Majesty Metals and Detroit Consolidated Mech Works. Both companies swiftly opened their own lines, producing multiple variants of the Talos for their own use and for export further afield.

'''Mechs/TLS-1P'''

==Description==

A relic of an earlier age, it’s a minor miracle this antique is still functional. Occasionally found through the frontier, surviving Taloses are a strange mix of new and old technology, bodged together by generations of different mectechs. Rarely seen and even more rarely fielded in battle, very few of these 500 year old designs still grace the modern battlefield, but those that do are treated with the respect and reverence, due to a centuries old design. The 1P is the ‘‘modern’’ adaption of the older 1B design and has proliferated in recent years, leading some to speculate that a cache of Talos or Talos parts has been found. Armed with a variety of local tech and a knock-off ecm suite, the 1P is a versatile design outfitted as a mid range brawler.

==Description==

While an exceptionally early design, the Talos by Vandenberg MilTech was a financial success and a long-standing general mech for the Taurian Defense Forces from its production in the 2530's well into the Succession Wars. An Autocannon/10, two LRM-5s, and an SRM-6 give the Talos weapons effective at multiple range bands while its 8.5 tons of armor give it some longevity on the battlefield.

'''Mechs/TBT-9K'''

==Description==

The 9K variant of the Trebuchet is a field refit of the 7M with a distinctive Kurita feel to it. Built on an Endo Steel chassis and powered by an XL engine, the 9K replaced the LRMs for two MRM-20launchers with three tons of ammo total. The medium lasers in the right arm are replaced with two Medium Pulse Lasers while the left arm-mounted medium laser is kept, and a C3 slave unit in the left torso allows it to share targeting telemetry with other units. The jump jets are also kept, giving it a jumping distance of one hundred and fifty meters.

==Description==

Upgraded with Star League technology, the 7M variant is built with on an Endo Steel chassis and uses a 250 Magna XL engine, giving it the same performance but allowing the design to mount ten double heat sinks and five Rawlings 50 jump jets for a jumping distance of one hundred and fifty meters. It also allows for the Zeus LRM-15s' ammo to be protected by CASE and for a Narc Missile Beacon with two tons of ammo, improving not only the Trebuchet's accuracy but allowing it to share targeting information with other similarly-equipped 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/TBT-5SP'''

==Description==

Rebuilt from the salvaged remains of a Trebuchet 5S, this low tech refit is a common sight throughout the battlefields of the Deep Periphery. Mounting between 2 and 4 Rocket pods and backed up by a pair of Large Chem Lasers; makes the 5SP into a fearsome short range brawler. Some designs include scavenged or salvaged Endo Steel or Ferro Fibrous, either for increased protection or to mount additional rocket pods. Limited by the 4 tons of Chemical Laser ammunition and the single salvos of the rocket pod, the SP lacks the endurance for protracted engagements. Fortunately these are rarely a concern in the Deep Periphery and this design is commonally seen during raids and border skirmishes, where its heavy fire power can give it an edge over less durable opponents.

==Description==

The original Trebuchet as produced for the SLDF, it consisted of two Artemis IV-equipped LRM-15s with CASE, four medium lasers, double heat sinks, an Endo-Steel chassis and a 300-rated Extra Light Fusion Engine. However, the attrition of the First Succession War forced Corean Enterprises into redesigning the 'Mech without advanced technology to keep the production lines running.

==Description==

The Uziel is not a ground breaking BattleMech design, especially when compared with some of the new designs to come out of Hesperus II. It does, however, incorporate several newly developed weapon systems intoan effective combat package. The Uziel carries a LB-2X Autocannon for hit and fade attacks which is backed up by a Large Pulse Laser at range and a bevy of ER lasers and a SRM 6 for close-range assault. Backed up with respectable speed and jump jets for maneuverability, the Uziel breaks no new ground but is a clean and effective design nonetheless.

'''Mechs/UZL-2S'''

==Description==

Based on the original prototype of the Uziel, the 2S carries a pair of PPCs as its primary weapons for long range combat. A SRM-6 launcher provides close combat capabilities and a pair of Machine Guns provide anti-infantry capabilities. A Beagle Active Probe allows the 'Mech to detect hidden units and protects the Uziel from ambushes.

'''Mechs/GWK-3'''

==Description==

Changes in the way the Clans fight since they made contact with the Inner Sphere led scientists from Clan Steel Viper to revisit the Vapor Eagle. They stripped out all the weaponry, but left everything else alone. This variant is effective at long range, as it mounts a Clan Mk. XVII ER PPC. The Fang Series-A ATM 3 replaced the Machine Guns of the original, though it only mounts one ton of ammunition, so the launcher loses the all-important flexibility of the Advanced Tactical Missile System. For close range, three Series 5K Heavy Medium Lasers provide a powerful punch, while a pair of Pattern D-II SRM-2 launchers add more damage potential.

==Description==

This variant of the Vapor Eagle removes two of the Medium Pulse Lasers, both Streak Missile pods, and the Large Pulse Laser as well as one of the 'Mechs double heat sinks in exchange for an Ultra Autocannon/10. Mounted in an over the shoulder arrangement like the venerable Shadow Hawk, the weapon fires at twice the rate of a standard Autocannon/10 and carries enough ammunition to continuously fire at its maximum rate of fire for over a minute and a half.

'''Mechs/GWK-1'''

==Description==

The Vapor Eagle features an eclectic and close-ranged weapons load-out, mounting a Large Pulse Laser in its right arm, supported by a single Machine Gun, two Streak SRM-2s and three Medium Pulse Lasers split between its side torsos and rounded out by a trio of Machine Guns in a handgun shaped housing in the left arm. The addition of a Targeting Computer makes its firepower even more deadly as long as it can get its weapons into range. Eleven Double Heat Sinks, half a ton of machine gun ammunition and one Streak missiles are more than adequate for the average Clan trial.

==Description==

Made in 3020, this customized Vindicator used by Major Choung Vong, in the Third Succession War, moved the head-mounted medium laser to the right arm, simply making the cockpit roomier for its brutally effective, but rather rotund pilot. It is by all accounts the same as the original 1R, retaining all its capabilities.

'''Mechs/VND-6L'''

==Description==

Vindicator 6L is simultaneously a cross between the 4L, 5L, and something completely new. The salvaged nature of the 6L makes it incredibly rare, with each one being ''handmade'' and awarded to only the most deserving Vindicator pilots.

'''Mechs/VND-3LD'''

==Description==

This custom-designed model is piloted by a Capellan bounty hunter, who goes by the moniker Dao. It has been rebuilt using Clan-technology heat sinks, Ferro-Fibrous Armor, and Endo Steel. A Clan ER PPC is the primary weapon, and the 'Mech also carries a BattleMech Taser to aid in capturing targets alive. A Supercharger and an Actuator Enhancement System add to the Vindicator's speed and accuracy.

'''Mechs/VND-1AAX'''

==Description==

A desperate field refit of the Confederations existing VND-1AA’s, the 1AAX was intensly loathed by the warriors assigned to it. Possessing less armour and weaponry than many comparable mechs, the 1AAX was designed as a highly mobile battlefield sniper; but struggled to survive once engaged by the enemy. A Partial Wing significantly boosted the designs mobility, whilst an Actuator Enhancement System bolstered the accuracy of the HPPC that constituted most of the designs fire power. The Small X-Pulse Laser and ER Medium Laser were insufficient fire power for anything other than anti infantry work, posing little threat to heavily armoured targets. The inclusion of Ferro Fibrous armour allowed the design team to somewhat improve protection, even if it still fell far behind that off other comparable mechs, whilst the Laser AMS provided a degree of protection against incoming missiles. Unsurprisingly the design suffered high losses in combat and many mech warriors refused their assignments; only accepting them once the alternatives were made clear.

'''Mechs/VT-6M'''

==Description==

Another upgrade of the 5M, this variant was produced by Nimakachi before their plant was destroyed, though only around thirty of these 'Mechs were produced and most were captured by the Blakists. The addition of an 240 XL Engine allowed engineers to swap out the lasers for an ER Medium and a Light Gauss Rifle with a generous two-ton ammunition bin. Its armor was upgraded to five tons of StarSlab 1/d Light Ferro-Fibrous to improve protection, especially around the arms.

'''Mechs/VT-6C'''

==Description==

The 6C was produced by the Word of Blake starting in 3070 so that their Vulcans could be integrated in a C3 network. This upgraded version of the 5M swapped out the lasers for an ER Large Laser and ER Medium Laser, respectively. The weight saved was used to install a C3i Computer. The removal of a heat sink allowed for the replacement of the machine gun with three Light Machine Guns linked to a Machine Gun Array.

==Description==

The Bloodlust is PGI's take on the hero release of the forthcoming Vulcan. Weaponry consists of two Machine Guns in the Left Arm, while a Small Laser and another Machine Gun round out the Right Arm. The Head, Right and Left Torso each carry an SRM-4, while four tons of ammo help keep the SRM's sufficiently supplied. Like all the current variants of the Canon versions, the Bloodlust is jump capable, however, has Standard Heat Sink capability.

'''Mechs/VL-VT-5S'''

==Description==

The 5S Vulcan is a 3050 upgrade of the 2T version used by House Steiner which replaces the standard fusion engine with an extralight engine and also upgrades the armor to Lexington Ltd. High Grade Ferro-Fibrous with CASE to protect itself from ammunition explosions. The inclusion of MASC enables the 5S to move up to 129 km/h in short bursts. Additionally, the Autocannon/2 has been replaced with an Imperator Ultra Autocannon/5.

'''Mechs/VL-VT-5ML'''

==Description==

With only a pair of Thunderbolt-5 launchers and a retractable blade for weapons, “Aladdin” isn’t a flashy fighter. Its Angel ECM and stealth armor give it the ability to hide in built up terrain, and thus surprise strikes are its best hope.

'''Mechs/VL-VT-5M'''

==Description==

The 5M Vulcan is an upgrade of the 2T version used by House Marik that makes the 'Mech far more effective in close range combat. The 'Mech uses a Crucis-II Delux Endo Steel chassis and removes the autocannon for a Tronel PPL-20 Large Pulse Laser and also upgrades the Medium Laser to a Tronel XII Medium Pulse Laser. Eleven double heat sinks were also incorporated. This version of the Vulcan began production in 3052 and ceased only with the destruction of Nimakachi's Tematagi plant in 3069.

'''Mechs/VL-7M'''

==Description==

The VL-7M retains the Endo Steel skeleton and fusion engine of the VL-5M. However, technicians considered its jump capacity more than sufficient for urban combat, and so reduced it to 120 meters. The weight and space saved by removing the two Jump Jets allows the design to carry seven and one half tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armor, the most protection this 'Mech has had at any time in its history. Furthermore, this is the first Vulcan to feature hand actuators. The new design features a Diverse Optics Extended Range Large Laser in the right torso and replaces the traditional arm-mounted Flamer with two Magna Medium Lasers, giving this Vulcan the punch to take on vehicles and light 'Mechs. A quartet of Magna Mk II Small Pulse Lasers fits snugly into the left arm; power conduits for this accurate anti-personnel array are routed along the same channel once used to feed that arm's single Machine Gun.

'''Mechs/VL-6M'''

==Description==

A further update of the -5T, the -6M uses Endo-Steel structure and an XL engine, drops half a ton of the Machine Gun ammunition and switches to Double Heatsinks. As a result the variant is able to replace the Lasers with 4 Medium Pulse Lasers, add a C3 slave unit, increase the amount of armor, upgrade the rating of the engine core to 280 and add an extra Jump Jet.

==Description==

One of the most common of the Vulcan's early variants, the 5T was introduced a year after the original model debuted. It removes the Autocannon/2 and replaces it with three Maxum medium lasers, using the mass saved to add two additional tons of armor. The majority of the Federated Suns' Vulcans were 5T models.

'''Mechs/VL-2T'''

==Description==

The Vulcan is lightly armored at only five tons, though this is typically sufficient when facing infantry forces and its narrow profile makes it a harder target to hit. A cruising speed of 64.8 km/h is enhanced with by six jump jets mounted in the rear of the Vulcan's torso, specially vented to reduce heat build-up in the rear, giving it a jumping range of 180 meters.

The Vulcan II VLC-N4M trades a Medium Pulse Laser for an Anti-Missile System and CASE. Short-Range Missiles are often the most common anti-'Mech weapon encountered at the infantry level, and so an AMS would increase the Vulcan II's survivability at little cost to its effectiveness.

'''Mechs/VLC-N3'''

==Description==

The Vulcan II VLC-N3 is roughly similar in layout to its predecessor. The N3 offers several new internal features, starting with its 280 extra light fusion engine and seven jump jets. The combination of an XL engine and an Endo Steel chassis permits the new design to carry eight and a half tons of Armor. The weaponry is equally impressive, the Vulcan II is equipped with 4 Small Pulse Lasers and 3 Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, the techs installed eleven double heat sinks, enough to allow a Vulcan II pilot to run and fire all his weapons without overheating. However, jumping poses a problem for careless MechWarriors, and can quickly disable those who ignore the heat meter during a battle.

'''Mechs/WTG-A10'''

==Description==

The original and considerably flawed prototypes were completed in 2680. Based on the Shadow Hawk SHD-2H, the 'Mech carried a Class 2 Autocannon in place of the Class 5. The SHD-X1 carried only 6.5 tons of armor for protection. Only one chassis survived multiple crashes caused by its faulty schematics. It had a top ground speed of 86.4 km/h like its progenitor, the SHD-2H, and used ten single heat sinks.

'''Mechs/WTC-4M'''

==Description==

Standing at ten meters tall, the Watchman is a 'Mech that was born of necessity. The idea for the design came when the bulk of the AFFS was moved to the Clan front. Because this seriously undermined the ability of the Federated Suns to keep its borders secure, the Watchman was designed to be distributed to militia units within the border marches to bulk up their strength. In its own right the Watchman is a durable and reliable 'Mech that is built with off the shelf components and is very easy to repair. The 'Mech is armored with eight and a half tons of standard armor, has a top speed of 86.4 km/h, and can jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. This, combined with the Watchman's varied arsenal, makes it an excellent trooper or trainer.

'''Mechs/WTH-K'''

==Description==

The Whitworth is something of an ugly duckling, known among both critics and fans as the Tin Woodsman. It was originally produced in 2610 as a BattleMech that was meant to fill the weight gap between the lighter Wasp and the heavier Phoenix Hawk 'Mechs. The Whitworth, though, is slower than either of these designs by over 30 km/h and plagued with a faulty actuator system in its hips and legs which could cause the legs to tear loose during strenuous maneuvers. Replacing the actuators would require a complete reworking of the lower half of the torso and leg assembly. However, the Whitworth carried eight tons of armor, utilized four reliable Whitworth Jetlift jump jets split between both legs for improved mobility, and featured excellent long-range firepower. The result was a 'Mech which could stand up in combat to another 'Mech of its equivalent mass and less. The original WTH-1S Whitworth model saw combat in the Age of War, however since it was armed with SRMs, many were lost when their pilots rushed into close-range combat to effectively use them. The Whitworth's lack of hand actuators, low speed curve, poor armor distribution and less-than-effective weapon loadout doomed them to the scrap pile. At the insistence of the Star League, the Whitworth Company replaced these weapons with LRMs in 2689 and the WTH-1 would serve in the Star League Defense Force as an able if mediocre scout and light strike platform. Whitworths often took part in reconnaissance-in-force missions and raids against well-defended areas, often alongside Wolverines and Phoenix Hawks, or provided fire support for heavy attack forces with Riflemans and Warhammers.

The Whitworth, though, is slower than either of these designs by over 30 km/h and plagued with a faulty actuator system in its hips and legs which could cause the legs to tear loose during strenuous maneuvers. Replacing the actuators would require a complete reworking of the lower half of the torso and leg assembly. However, the Whitworth carried eight tons of armor, utilized four reliable Whitworth Jetlift jump jets split between both legs for improved mobility, and featured excellent long-range firepower. The result was a 'Mech which could stand up in combat to another 'Mech of its equivalent mass and less. The original WTH-1S Whitworth model saw combat in the Age of War, however since it was armed with SRMs, many were lost when their pilots rushed into close-range combat to effectively use them. The Whitworth's lack of hand actuators, low speed curve, poor armor distribution and less-than-effective weapon loadout doomed them to the scrap pile. At the insistence of the Star League, the Whitworth Company replaced these weapons with LRMs in 2689 and the WTH-1 would serve in the Star League Defense Force as an able if mediocre scout and light strike platform. Whitworths often took part in reconnaissance-in-force missions and raids against well-defended areas, often alongside Wolverines and Phoenix Hawks, or provided fire support for heavy attack forces with Riflemans and Warhammers.

'''Mechs/WVR-RFL3'''

==Description==

The Wolfman was first created by Valdis Ullman, a MechWarrior belonging to the Legion of Vega, on Bergman's Planet during the Second Battle of Ryersson in 2986. Originally piloting a Wolverine, his BattleMech was damaged in a fight with a Davion Marauder, with most of its upper body damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, a Davion Rifleman had been destroyed only a hundred meters away from his 'Mech. The Rifleman had suffered damage to its torso and legs. Ullman's personal technician, Sharis Brand thought that the two 'Mechs could be merged together, taking the intact legs and hips from Ullman's Wolverine and combining it with the torso and arms from the Rifleman.

The Wolfman was first created by Valdis Ullman, a MechWarrior belonging to the Legion of Vega, on Bergman's Planet during the Second Battle of Ryersson in 2986. Originally piloting a Wolverine, his BattleMech was damaged in a fight with a Davion Marauder, with most of its upper body damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, a Davion Rifleman had been destroyed only a hundred meters away from his 'Mech. The Rifleman had suffered damage to its torso and legs. Ullman's personal technician, Sharis Brand thought that the two 'Mechs could be merged together, taking the intact legs and hips from Ullman's Wolverine and combining it with the torso and arms from the Rifleman.

'''Mechs/WVR-7M'''

==Description==

The 7M variant of the Wolverine has aspects of both the 7D and the 7K versions but is much closer to the original model. Introduced by FWDI in 3050 the 'Mech uses an XL engine, which is augmented with MASC, so as to push the machine up to 108 km/h in bursts. The 7M has twelve double heat sinks and, for a weapons package, it carries two Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Lasers in the right arm and two Magna 400P medium pulse lasers in the head mount while retaining the SRM-6 for close range work.

'''Mechs/WVR-7D'''

==Description==

The 7D variant of the Wolverine is a major upgrade to the design introduced in 3050 by the Federated Suns' new Nanking factory. The standard engine on the 'Mech was replaced with a Nissan 275 XLversion and the armor has been upgraded to Kallon Unity Weave Ferro-Fibrous material with an extra half-ton added. To increase the Wolverine's speed, MASC has been added, allowing it to move up to 108 km/h in bursts. Finally, the weapons payload has been upgraded as well. The autocannon has been upgraded to a General Motors Nova-5 Ultra Autocannon/5 and the medium laser is now a Sutel Precision Line Medium Pulse Laser. The design retains its jumping capability, as well as the SRM-6, although CASE now protects the SRM reloads

'''Mechs/WVR-6T'''

==Description==

A Taurian variant, the WVR-6T design was created to capitalize on the less expensive ballistic weapons that were readily available within the Concordat to reduce their reliance on Star League member states. The 6T was also meant to act as anti-pirate garrison 'Mech, utilizing its long range AC/5 and LRM-5 combo to engage raiders at range.  While the swap out of the Medium Laser for a Small Laser and the addition of two Machine Guns allow this Wolverine variant to better engage with the light vehicles and infantry common to raiding forces.

==Description==

The Wraith marked Curtiss Militech's entry into BattleMech production. When the design was announced, many felt that the design would be little more than a walking water cooler. What the critics got was a shock. The Wraith is a 'Mech that, when properly employed, can wreak havoc on an enemy with its astounding speed and maneuverability. It is built around a massive LTV 385 XL Engine that allows it to reach speeds of just under 119 kph. The Wraith has a simple, yet effective, pulse weapons payload. Pulse laser weaponry allows the Mech to negate most of the side effects on accuracy that are introduced by the Wraith's heavy use of jump jets, making it incredibly accurate and powerful for such a lightly armed Mech. A modification of the Wraith made by the Word of Blake, the TR3 replaces the two Medium Pulse Lasers with two ER Medium Lasers while one of the jump jets is removed to make room for an improved C3 computer, making the Wraith an incredibly powerful point 'Mech for units equipped with C3i equipment.

'''Mechs/ZU-R88'''

==Description==

The Anzu was well-regarded by both MechWarriors and technicians for its reliability; the AMSC found the Anzu to be a good fit for the aggressive combat tactics they had developed since the Jihad. Although the Anzu's maximum ground speed was 64 kph, the Chilton 465 Jump Jets allowed the Anzu to jump up to 120 meters. The Anzu mounted eleven tons of Starshield A Standard Armor with CASE II built in to protect the 'Mech and its pilot from ammunition explosions. The Anzu also used the same life support systems as the Shadow Hawk, already well-proven by the time the Anzu entered service, and the RCA Instatrac Mark X targeting and tracking system allowed the Anzu to simultaneously engage multiple targets while also spotting for indirect fire through the installed TAG system.

This variant of the Archer carried Clan-spec equipment. The arms mounted ER Large Lasers, while a pair of Small Pulse Lasers covered the rear. The LRM-20s were enhanced with Artemis IV Fire Control Systems, and an ECM Suite and AMS protected against incoming fire. CASE was carried in each side torso and fifteen double heat sinks kept the 'Mech cool.

'''Mechs/ARC-C2'''

==Description==

A staple of Escorpion Imperrio fire support lances, the ARC-C2 is the result of a refit programmed carried out to rearm the depleted Scorpion Touman. Constructed with Archer 2R’s or 2RB’s that the Scorpions have salvaged or recovered from various Brian Caches; and paired with several advanced weapons systems, the C2 is a deadly opponents equally adept at blasting enemies from range or surprising them at closer quarters. Dual Improved Heavy Medium Lasers provide a devastating shock to opponents who fail to recognise the variant, while four LRM-15’s and an Artemis V FCS enable the mech to pound targets at any range. With the sheer numbers of Archer 2R’s in existence, the Imperrio has plenty of raw material to work with; a fact not lost on the Imperrio leadership who have authorised increased production of this mech to fill much needed fire support roles.

'''Mechs/ARC-9M'''

==Description==

This variant used a 210 Light Engine, which dropped the top speed to 54 km/h, but five Improved Jump Jets were added to compensate for this lack of speed. Built in 3076, the standard weapons were replaced by a Delta Dart LRM-15 with Artemis IV FCS and an Diverse Optics ER Medium Laser in each torso, and a Defiance 250 Light PPC was mounted in each arm. Eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor and CASE protected the 'Mech.

'''Mechs/ARC-8M'''

==Description==

The 8M variant of the Archer was built on an Endo Steel chassis and mixed elements of several past variants. Introduced in 3067 by Earthwerks for the Word of Blake Militia, this variant was armed with two Delta Dart LRM-15 launchers linked to Artemis IV fire control systems in either side torso and an Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Laser in the center torso for long-range combat. It also mounted three Diverse Optics Sunfire ER Medium Lasers for short ranged support, one in each arm and the third in its head. This made the 8M effective at all ranges and gave it both long-range direct and indirect capabilities. The 8M was protected by thirteen and a half tons of Maximilian 100 standard armor which was better slopped in order to deflect weapons fire more easily. It carried twelve double heat sinks, and had a similar speed profile to the original Archer. Its upper body traversing assembly was improved over the original to better protect its hip actuators and its feet were redesigned to make it a more stable firing platform, whether standing or on the move. Four tons of LRM reloads were split between the side torsos and were protected by CASE.

==Description==

The Archer 7S was an upgrade of the 6S model, and was introduced in 3070. It used Durallex Guardian Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor with CASE in place of the Endo Steel structure used on the 6S. The 7S had two LRM-20 launchers with Artemis IV for increased missile accuracy and, for close range defense, carried a Diverse Optics ER Medium Laser and a rear facing Magna 200P Small Pulse Laser in addition to the pair of Hovertec Streak SRM-2 launchers.

'''Mechs/ARC-7L'''

==Description==

Built for the Capellan Confederation by Earthwerks in 3067, the 7L variant of the Archer incorporated new Stealth Armor and a Guardian ECM Suite for protection against enemy electronics in addition to making the Archer harder to target. The 'Mech carried twelve and a half tons of Stealth Armor and was armed with two LRM-20 launchers and two ER Medium Lasers. The trade-off for this massive upgrade was that the 'Mech's top speed was reduced to 54 km/h. In an attempt to compensate for this, the 'Mech also had three jump jets mounted, making it capable of jumping up to ninety meters at a time. The 7L was slated to enter the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces' new Shadow Lances.

'''Mechs/ARC-6S'''

==Description==

The 6S variant of the Archer was built in 3067 by Bowie Industries using a new Light Fusion Engine, which weighed three quarters of the mass of the original engine. The 'Mech carried two LRM-20 launchers linked to an Artemis IV fire control system, two Streak SRM-2 launchers, and two medium Lasers for close combat. As a defensive measure, the 'Mech had an ER Small Laser mounted in the rear of its head. The variant carried six tons of ammo for the LRM and two tons for the SRM, all of which were protected by CASE.

'''Mechs/ARC-5W'''

==Description==

The 5W was an upgrade of the 2W variant, and was produced for the Wolf's Dragoons by Bowie Industries at Alarion. This was done in an orbital 'Mech repair facility which was converted into a 'Mech assembly line. Introduced in 3050, the 'Mech was upgraded with an XL Engine to save weight and used ten double heat sinks for greater heat dissipation. It retained the two LRM-20 launchers but replaced all other weaponry with one TharHes Blue SRM-4 launchers in each arm and a Doering Electronics Glowworm Narc Missile Beacon launcher in the center torso. The 5W was supplied with four tons of LRM reloads, two tons of SRM reloads, and two tons of Narc reloads, all carried in the CASE-protected side torsos.

'''Mechs/ARC-5S'''

==Description==

The 5S variant of the Archer, built out of Defiance Industries' massive Hesperus II complex in 3050, was the official variant for the Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth. The 5S upgraded the engine to an Edasich Motors 280 XL Engine, cutting the engine's weight in half while retaining the same speed profile. The 5S also reduced the LRM-20 launchers to LRM-15s. This saved weight was used to add two Coventry T4H Streak SRM-2 launchers, one in each arm and fed by two tons of reloads in the side torsos. They also upgraded the four medium lasers to Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, the 'Mech carried a Doering Electronics Glowworm Narc Missile Beacon launcher in its left torso along with one ton of ammo. This allowed the Archer to tag enemy units with a beacon so that friendly 'Mechs could more easily hit the unit with their own missile weapons. All of the ammunition carried by the 5S was protected by CASE.

'''Mechs/ARC-5R'''

==Description==

Built by the GKT Enterprise factory on Satalice for the Free Rasalhague Republic, the 5R was introduced in 3050 and bore similarities to the 2K model of the Archer. It carried a pair of FarFire LRM-15 launchers but mounted two Victory Nickel Alloy ER Large Lasers, one in either arm, in place of the medium lasers. It also linked Artemis IV fire control systems to the launchers and utilized twelve double heat sinks to improve waste heat dissipation. Despite being built around an Endo-Steel chassis, these improvements necessitated a decrease in armor protection by two tons.

'''Mechs/AGS-6F'''

==Description==

The 6F Argus was introduced during the Jihad. During this time, the XL Fusion engine of the original was replaced by a Light Fusion Engine. The increased weight of this engine required the engineers to remove several weapons. The 6F carries a pair of Medium Lasers and an SRM-6, but most of its firepower is found in the right arm Autocannon/20. The 6F is protected by Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, and carries ten double heat sinks.

==Description==

A versatile, yet simple configuration of the Avatar, the F configuration is armed with an ER PPC and an LB-X Autocannon/20. A MechWarrior can utilize the ER PPC for long range combat and once it closes in it can let loose with the armor shredding LB-X AC/20. These potent weapons are backed up by the two hardwired Medium Lasers. Additionally, for added mobility, the F configuration can jump up to one hundred and twenty meters.

==Description==

Used by ComStar and the Word of Blake, the E configuration is armed with an ER PPC for long range punch and can bring its powerful Ultra Autocannon/10 to bear as it closes with its enemy. If the target of the Avatar Es pilot survives long range combat, an ER Medium Laser and the two hard-wired Medium Lasers give the E configuration good short range firepower. Accuracy at all ranges is improved by the use of a C3i Computer. It is also equipped with a Guardian ECM Suite to protect the network from breaking.

'''Mechs/AXM-4D'''

==Description==

An attempt to reduce reliance upon foreign equipment, this exclusively Davion variant replaced the 1N line on New Syrtis in 3071. It drops the jump jets, lasers, and large-bore autocannon in favor of four Light Autocannon/5s, supplemented by two medium lasers. Two tons of ammunition stored in a CASE protected bay allows for some flexibility in the choice of munitions. A Targeting Computer improves the accuracy of all the weapons on the 'Mech. It uses Ferro-Fibrous armor for protection.

'''Mechs/AXM-3S'''

==Description==

The Furillo manufactured 3S introduced in 3057 removes the XL Engine of the 1N and 2N variants and replaces it with a Light Fusion Engine. This exclusively Lyran variant of the Axman is armed with a massive LB-X Autocannon/20, which allows it to fire either solid rounds or cluster rounds that act like a 'Mech sized shotgun. The 'Mech also carries three ER Medium Lasers for close combat and a Guardian ECM Suite, which defends against enemy electronic warfare equipment.

'''Mechs/AXM-2N'''

==Description==

The 2N variant of the Axman, introduced in the late 3040s, has been called a mistake by some and a stroke of genius by others. The 2N carries two LRM-15 launchers in place of the massive Autocannon/20 as the autocannon often jammed on early models. While this changes the 'Mech's role from a city fighter to a long-range bombardment 'Mech, it also allows the Axman to be a support 'Mech that can defend itself with its massive Hatchet at ranges where the LRMs are ineffective if an enemy closes.

'''Mechs/BKX-7NC'''

==Description==

With the introduction of the BattleAxe’s successor, the Hammerhands, no official variants ever surfaced. However, many MechWarriors, especially those who never quite learned to manage the BattleAxe as it leapt through the air, had technicians remove the temperamental jump jets and install a second LRM 5 in each torso, deeming it the “No Crash” version, or simply 7NC.

'''Mechs/BKX-7K'''

==Description==

The original production variant of this 'Mech, the BKX-7K, utilizes two massive Donal Particle Projection Cannons, which were relatively new at the time. To support the massive cannons, it also has two Federated-5 Shot LRM-5 launchers with one ton of ammo to split between them and a Harpoon-6 SRM-6, giving it something to hit with at all ranges.

'''Mechs/BL-X-KNT'''

==Description==

Based on a BL-9-KNT chassis, this personal ride of Reginald VanJaster was created during the Word of Blake's occupation of Solaris. The standard weaponry was removed and replaced with a Large Shield and Large Vibroblade for hand to hand combat, while five Medium X-Pulse Lasers inflict huge amounts of damage in close quarter combat. For long range firepower, a single Heavy PPC paired with a PPC Capacitor are used. The whole 'Mech is protected by thirteen tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor. Fifteen double heat sinks are available to dissipate heat.

'''Mechs/BL-6B-KNT'''

==Description==

The Black Knight 6B was the harder-hitting, cooler-running Star League ancestor to the standard BL-6-KNT we have today. It did everything the 6 does, but better. Mostly thanks to its Double Heat Sinks.

==Description==

The Black Python is similar in many ways to the Warhammer and Marauder BattleMechs. Though it is faster than those heavies, it has a similar weapons load-out with comparable damage, albeit with much more accurate damage potential. In order to achieve this, this expensive second-line 'Mech avails itself of all weight saving technologies that were at the disposal of the Clans, including an XL Engine, Endo Steel frame, and eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor.

'''Mechs/BMB-14K'''

==Description==

An upgrade of mothballed BMB-10Ds and -12Ds reintroduced by the Combine in response to the Alliance's -05As, the -14K strips out the weapons and equipment and adds a half ton of armor. Four MML 7s provide firepower at all ranges, though the five tons of ammunition are vulnerable in their arm mount. A C3 Slave Unit allows the 14K to share targeting telemetry with like-equipped friendly units and three Machine Guns linked to a Machine Gun Array in the right arm can prove devastating to unarmored infantry.

'''Mechs/BMB-14C'''

==Description==

This ComStar variant upgraded the capabilities of the Bombardier while at the same time attempting to address one of the primary issues of the design. The LRM launchers have been mated to a pair of Artemis IV Fire Control Systems while the new electronics package includes an improved C3 computer and the amount of ammunition carried was doubled. These changes increased the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the paired LRM-20s and were implemented by sacrificing the SRM launcher and Anti-Missile System. For close range defense, the 14C carries an ER Small Laser, while the chassis has been upgraded using Endo-Steel.

'''Mechs/BMB-12D'''

==Description==

Continuing the trend toward specialized BattleMechs, the Bombardier was proposed to the Star League in 2735 by Wakazashi Enterprises as an "artillery 'Mech." The concept behind the design was to make a BattleMech that could replace less-mobile artillery vehicles, which might fall behind in an advance or be destroyed by counter-battery fire. It would be well-protected with twelve and a half tons of armor and use specialized missile racks which could carry diverse types of advanced missiles. Over years of testing and field exercises the Bombardier proved itself extremely effective at fulfilling the long-range fire support role, easily surpassing its vehicular counterparts and even inspiring talks of disbanding the SLDF's artillery arm once enough Bombardiers were operational.

'''Mechs/BMB-10D'''

==Description==

The 10D variant of the Bombardier is a refit performed by Earthwerks Incorporated during the Succession Wars as many advanced components became lostech; while Wakazashi were content not to manufacture any more Bombardiers, the company was prepared to license Earthwerks to produce parts for existing 'Mechs, resulting in the 10D refit. While the Delphinius and Arrowlight launchers were swapped out for low-tech Doombud and Hovertech models, the AMS system was completely replaced with a Machine Gun. Perhaps the biggest difference was the replacement of VOX 325 XL engine with the smaller Magna 260, giving the design a top speed of 64.8km/h and cruising speed of 43km/h. In addition, the CASE that protected the vulnerable ammunition stores has been removed from the design, while the armor protection itself has not changed. As a part of the refit performed by Earthwerks in their Calloway VI plant the communications system was replaced with the Neil 5000 system and the targeting and tracking system was replaced with the RCA Instatrac Mark XII system.

'''Mechs/BMB-05A'''

==Description==

Fielded by the Outworlds Alliance, the -05A is such a powerful upgrade that many have wondered whether the original model was merely a testbed. The most radical change is the replacement of the LRMs for an Arrow IV Artillery launcher with four tons of ammunition, giving it a reach beyond most other conventional machines. Three Doomsbud Rocket Launcher 20s replace the SRM launcher and provide short range firepower that can make light 'Mechs think twice about closing with the Bombardier. A Small Laser seems an afterthought, though the Anti-Missile System ammo has been doubled.

==Description==

The -4S variant, that first saw use during the FedCom Civil War, is intended for close-range combat. The vulnerable XL Engine has been replaced with a sturdier Light Fusion Engine, and has been redesigned to use an Endo Steel internal structure. The 'Mech is armed with a Heavy Gauss Rifle as its primary weapon. This is backed up by a Large Pulse Laser, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and a pair of ER Medium Lasers.

A variant that first saw action during the Jihad, the -4R attempts to improve upon the -3R variant marketed in the Federated Suns. Designed with short-range combat in mind, it drops the rear-facing pulse lasers and three heat sinks in favor of additional armor and three ER Medium Lasers. MASC enables the Caesar to close more quickly and bring its Snub-Nose PPC to bear.

'''Mechs/CRN-7M'''

==Description==

Manufactured on Emris IV by StarCorps Industries, the Carronade was designed to fill roles normally taken by two seperate 'Mechs within the same lance - punching holes in the armor of enemy units, and then exploiting those holes with waves of small munitions.

'''Mechs/CTF-IM'''

==Description==

The Cataphract Hero 'Mech, Grigori Kovalenko's custom Cataphract 'Ilya Muromets', Identification Number CTF2X0042A-1013, is armed with an AC/5 in each arm, supported by a right arm Small Laser, a Medium Laser in each side torso and a right torso mounted AC/10. Such a heavy autocannon loadout is made possible through the use of 280 rated XL engine, while three tons of AC/5 rounds and two of AC/10 reloads keep those cannons firing.

'''Mechs/CTF-5D'''

==Description==

This upgrade of the 3D removes the weapons and is powered by a Light Fusion Engine along with enough improved jump jets to leap up to one hundred and eighty meters. This enables it to bring its Plasma Rifle and Light Autocannon/5 to bear, though a one-ton ammunition bin for the autocannon limits its ability to use special munitions. Two ER Medium Lasers provide backup in case an enemy closes with the Cataphract. The variant is protected by Stealth armor and Guardian ECM. The inclusion of a Small Cockpit allows for the armor to be increased to eleven and a half tons worth.

'''Mechs/CTF-4L'''

==Description==

A Capellan upgrade produced during the 3060s, the 4L was built using a standard fusion engine and utilized thirteen and a half tons of Stealth Armor along with a Guardian ECM suite for protection. The 'Mech is armed with a Gauss Rifle and an ER PPC as its primary weapons, giving it a powerful long-range punch. For close range defense, the 'Mech carries two ER Medium Lasers. Produced in the wake of the Xin Sheng movement and the recapture of Tikonov, the CTF-4L was intended for the growing number of Shadow Lances within the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces.

==Description==

This basic refit of the 3L replaced the PPC with a Plasma Rifle. Tonnage was freed up for its three tons of ammunition by swapping out the two forward-facing pulse lasers for ER Medium Lasers. The reduced heat load gives the 3LL the luxury of not building heat before it is damaged.

'''Mechs/CTF-3L'''

==Description==

Produced by the Capellans based on stolen Davion designs, the 3L is an upgraded version of the Cataphract that follows more in line with the prototype 1X model. It is propelled by an XL Engine with MASC instead of jump jets allowing it to reach speeds of 86.4 km/h in short bursts. While it is also armed with an LB-X Autocannon/10 as its primary weapon this is instead matched with a Ceres Arms Warrior ER PPC for powerful striking capabilities at long range. Other differences include the use of four Medium Pulse Lasers and double heat sinks in place of the standard models. This design was produced by the Confederation at Grand Base following the ascension of Chancellor Romano Liao.

'''Mechs/CTF-3D'''

==Description==

The longest ranged weapon carried by the CTF-3D Cataphract is a General Motors Nova-5 Ultra AC-5 in its right arm, boasting a rate of fire twice that of a standard autocannon. This is backed up by a Mydron Excel LB-X Autocannon/10 in its right torso, capable of firing both solid and cluster rounds. It is a more popular weapon than the Ultra AC-5, especially for use in an anti-conventional and anti-aircraft role without the possibility of jamming. Finally, the 'Mech has four Intek Medium Lasers for close range defense, one in each arm firing forward and two in its torso covering the rear. With only two tons of ammo for the LB-X 10 and one ton for the Ultra, if it runs dry the Cataphract must fall back to be reloaded before continuing the fight. Eleven tons of armor combined with CASE allowed the Cataphract to easily absorb damage. Sixteen heat sinks keep it cool while four HildCo Model 12 jump jets gave it a jumping distance of one hundred and twenty meters. Room for these improvements was made by using a GM 280 XL Engine.

'''Mechs/CPLT-J'''

==Description==

A field refit given popularity after repeated sightings in combat piloted by MechWarrior Leigh Voss, the CLPT-Jester typically begins life as a refit kit for a CPLT-K2 or similar variant. Stripping out the PPCs, the Jester manages to run enough power couplings to cram a laser into each arm, each side torso, and two in the center torso, with additional fittings for support weapons if available. It also mounts an AMS system and advanced TTS systems, allowing for lethally accurate fire even beyond traditional weapon ranges. The only major advanced piece of kit is its Endo-Steel structure; the engine and armor are both standard, making the Jester quite tough. With a plethora of double heat sinks keeping it's weapons cool and the ability to lay down volley after pinpoint volley of fire, the Jester is simple, but not to be underestimated.

==Description==

An upgrade of the C3 model, this variant first appeared during the St. Ives Conflict. It retains the Arrow IV artillery system, but its chassis has been upgraded to Endo Steel and its heat sinks to improved versions. This allows the C5 to increase its armor coverage to twelve and a half tons, upgrade its lasers to ER Medium Lasers, and quadruple the amount of ammo carried with protection provided by CASE.

'''Mechs/CPLT-C3'''

==Description==

The C3 variant takes the 'Mech's long range fire support to a new level by removing both of the LRM-15 launchers and replacing them with an Arrow IV artillery system, allowing the Catapult to stay a safe distance from the battlefield.

==Description==

This variant is built using a Hollis Marik III Endo Steel chassis and powered by a Magna 260 extralight engine, using the saved weight to make the C2 a dedicated long range 'Mech. The primary weapons are two Federated LRM-15 launchers mated to an Artemis IV fire control system. The Medium Lasers have been replaced with two Defiance Shredder LB-X Autocannon/2s. While this makes the Catapult vulnerable to close range attacks, it also makes it extremely deadly at long range.

'''Mechs/CPLT-L7L'''

==Description==

The Catapult II retains the original's movement, jump capabilities and has a half ton more armor protection than its predecessor. Introduced a year after the base model in 3136, the advanced L7L is designed as a more conventional Capellan design with enhanced armor. The 'Mech trades in all its base weaponry for two Plasma Rifles mounted in each of the side torsos, and two 9-tube Multi-Missile Launchers. The design's most noted feature is its Heat-Dissipating Armor, which offers the variant greater resistance to heat related attacks.

'''Mechs/CPLT-L7'''

==Description==

The Catapult II retains the original's movement, jump capabilities and has a half ton more armor protection than its predecessor. The Catapult's most notable weapons are its two TSEMP Cannons mounted in the side torsos, which allow it to potentially disable an enemy 'Mech. Serving as back up are more conventional weapons, a pair of Diverse Optics Sunfire Extended Range Medium Lasers that are located in the center torso. A Chameleon Light Polarization Suite is integrated into the chassis aswell.

'''Mechs/CPLT-IIC-4'''

==Description==

A joint research project between Clans Coyote and Star Adder, the Catapult IIC-3 mates the new ATM launchers with a pair of Heavy Medium Lasers. The base of the 3 is an IS Catapult taken as isorla by the Adders during the Great Refusal and rebuilt to Clan standards. The inclusion of the Heavy Medium Lasers was a concession demanded by the Adders in exchange for the supply of the Catapults. Conceived as an experimental testbed for the ATM's, the 3 only had a limited production run. Combat testing revealed it to be an effective brawler and multirange missile platform; complementing older IIC and second line designs. Mostly fielded by the Coyotes, who retain the original production run; the Adders also field a small number of field conversions that are more or less identical to the design.

'''Mechs/CHP-3P'''

==Description==

The 3P is the newest variant of the Champion, introduced in 3061. The 'Mech's arsenal has been completely upgraded to modern standards with the complete removal of all of its weapons. In their place this version of the Champion carries four ER Medium Lasers, one in each arm. An Ultra Autocannon/10 replaces the LB-X Autocannon and the SRM-6 has been replaced by an improved Narc Missile Beacon. In addition, the ExtraLight engine used in the 3N has been retained and an improved C3 computer was added to allow the Champion to work as part of a 6-unit C3 network.

'''Mechs/CHP-3N'''

==Description==

One of the so-called "Clanbuster" variants developed in 3052 by ComStar in the lead-up to the Battle of Tukayyid, this variant is a major upgrade that replaces the standard fusion engine with a lighter but more vulnerable 300 rated ExtraLight engine, the heat sinks have been upgraded to double heat sinks and two Large Lasers, surplus from the Clanbuster upgrade of the Wyvern, have been added to the 'Mech's unoccupied arms.

'''Mechs/CHP-2N'''

==Description==

The Champion debuted in 2602 as a generalist combat 'Mech with a focus on heavy reconnaissance and fast strike capabilities. While definitely faster and more maneuverable than other heavy 'Mechs, it was criticized by many for being too large, underarmed and underarmored. The armament on the Champion is considered by many to be feeble for its size, especially after losing its advanced technology from the Star League. Carrying an AC/10, a SRM 6, and a pair each of Medium and Small Lasers, the Champion is woefully underarmed for its size.

'''Mechs/CHP-1NB'''

==Description==

A variant reserved for SLDF Royal units, this Champion was introduced in 2751 and replaces all the standard weaponry with a Gauss Rifle and ER PPC. It also uses double heat sinks. This gave the -1Nb an extremely long range weapon profile and a serious punch while also solving its heat issues.

'''Mechs/CHP-1N2'''

==Description==

During the Star League when the Champion-1N was in full production, there was a frequent pilot modification that turned into a production variant. This mech, the -1N2, is exactly the same as the -1N with the exception of the heat sinks, which have been upgraded to doubles. In all other respects, the -1N2 is the same as the -1N.

'''Mechs/CHP-1N'''

==Description==

Where the CHP-2N is the downgraded Succession Wars variant of the Champion, the -1N is the fully powered Star League variant and is the original one the designers introduced. The high speed for a mech its size remains as does the somewhat anemic armor, the main benefit the mech gets from Star League technology is found in the weaponry: a LB-10X Autocannon, a SRM 6 with an Artemis IV system, and a pair each of Medium and Small Lasers. Otherwise, the -1N is much the same as the -2N and performs the same in many ways.

'''Mechs/CGR-PB'''

==Description==

Punch Bot started as an standard CGR-1A1 of a lance sized merc unit with limited funds available.  The first pilot repeatedly threw his 'Mech first into every tough situation hoping to to be able to collect the insurance on the Charger, but the 'Mech just wouldn't die.  Eventially the unit realized they could save over 10 tons by replacing the LTV 400 Engine with a GM 380 out of a salvaged Banshee.  The then dropped 5 of those tons of the 'Mech's overall weight to keep the same stop speed.  The extra tonnage allowed them to embrach Punch Bot's usual tactics with mounting Jump Jets, a ton and a half extra armor and upgraded arm actuators.

'''Mechs/CRS-6B'''

==Description==

Considered to be a middleweight machine compared to the heavier Mackies and Ymirs already in circulation, the Crossbow was built to be a fast missile support unit. As was the case with the Coventry Defense Conglomerate, Arcturan Arms’ engineers initially failed to make their prototype Crossbow live up to expectations, but as the techniques for producing BattleMechs grew more refined, the Crossbow received an upgrade worthy of its original concept.

'''Mechs/CRD-3L'''

==Description==

The 3L variant of the Crusader takes concepts from both the 3D and the 3K models to save weight with a twist. Built for the Capellan Confederation starting in 2753, the 'Mech has removed the LRM-15 and SRM-6 launchers and replaced them with two LRM-10 launchers and two SRM-4 launchers. This frees up room for two additional heat sinks as well as the inclusion of four GM Jetstar jump jets, two each in either side torso, giving it a jumping distance of one hundred and twenty meters.

'''Mechs/CRD-3D'''

==Description==

The 3D variant of the Crusader is a simple modification to make the 'Mech's heat load more manageable. Introduced in 2756 and used mostly by House Davion, the two SRM-6 launchers were replaced with two SRM-4 launchers and the machine guns were removed so that the number of heat sinks could be increased by four.

'''Mechs/C-DVA-OD'''

==Description==

Another of the Word of Blake's Celestial series OmniMechs, the Deva (named for celestial beings from the Hindu belief system) also makes extensive use of new technologies. It is built with a light fusion engine, a heavy-duty gyro that can take half again as much punishment as its standard counterpart, and the small cockpit common to all of the Celestials. This configuration has enough weapons to feel at home at range or up close. Like the Comminus variant, it mounts enough jump jets to leap up to 120 meters at a time. For long-range combat, the Deva D mounts a Heavy PPC. In close, two ER Mediums and four Medium Pulse Lasers can quickly disable an opponent.

The Invictus model makes good use of its C3i Computer with a Gauss Rifle and a trio of Light PPCs. Obviously meant as a direct-fire support model, the inclusion of the Retractable Blade is somewhat confusing to outsiders, as is the paltry ton of ammunition devoted to the design's main gun.

Adding to that A pair of Medium Pulse Lasers that also benefit from the advanced computer can be utilized should an enemy get within range. Defensively, a Guardian ECM Suite ensures that enemies cannot benefit from electronics against the Deva or its nearby allies.

It is built with a light fusion engine, a heavy-duty gyro that can take half again as much punishment as its standard counterpart, and the small cockpit common to all of the Celestials. The centerpiece of the Deva E is an experimental Thunderbolt 15. Similar to the Invictus variant, the Eminus mounts four Light PPCs and only carries eight rounds for its largest gun. In place of the primary configuration's Retractable Blade, the Deva E carries a pair of ER Medium Lasers, though one arm is left free of weapons.

==Description==

Another of the Word of Blake's Celestial series OmniMechs, the Deva (named for celestial beings from the Hindu belief system) also makes extensive use of new technologies. It is built with a light fusion engine, a heavy-duty gyro that can take half again as much punishment as its standard counterpart, and the small cockpit common to all of the Celestials. This variant uses a Rotary Autocannon/5 and a Multi-Missile Launcher 7. CASE protects the ammunition for both of these weapons. A Light PPC, an ER Small Laser, and a pair of ER Medium Lasers back them up.

==Description==

Another of the Word of Blake's Celestial series OmniMechs, the Deva (named for celestial beings from the Hindu belief system) also makes extensive use of new technologies. It is built with a light fusion engine, a heavy-duty gyro that can take half again as much punishment as its standard counterpart, and the small cockpit common to all of the Celestials. The Comminus variant is designed to mix it up close to enemies, a task it is aided in by the mobility that jump jets give it. An Ultra Autocannon/20 is still the most powerful gun in the Inner Sphere's arsenal. A three-ton, CASE-protected ammunition bin keeps it in supply, though a MechWarrior should not waste shots. For that, he or she can utilize the trio of ER Medium Laser and the single ER Small. Like the Infernus, the Deva C is protected by an ECM Suite.

It is built with a light fusion engine, a heavy-duty gyro that can take half again as much punishment as its standard counterpart, and the small cockpit common to all of the Celestials.

This Custom Dragon was piloted by Warlord Syovo Yorioshi from 25th May to 26th September 3025 during the Battle of Galtor III. Only the left-arm mounted Medium Laser remains, with Large Laser in the right arm and an SRM4 and Flamer mounted in the Center. A Small Laser was also installed next to the Cockpit, with an additional 5 Heat Sinks and 3 more tons of armor.

'''Mechs/DRG-1N'''

==Description==

The Dragon 1N is a beefy machine that can take a serious beating but tends to be a bit light on weaponry. It moves fast for a heavy 'Mech, though, which makes it well suited to closing for Melee attacks against slower targets.

The Dragon II is a Heavy BattleMech built by LAW for the armed forces of the Draconis Combine during the post-Jihad era. Built as a successor to the aging Dragon, the 'Mech was designed with Advanced Technology to allow it to handle threats of the new era. The design was phased in as a replacement to the older Dragons, which were nearing the end of their service lives.

==Description==

Named after the Unstoppable Zombies of Irish Folklore, this Ebon Jaguar refit was designed to be a truly menacing threat. When it finally saw action, the experimental armor equipped was described by a Private Lu Ban of the DCMS as 'Living Ferro-Fibrous'. He further remarked '...them egg-heads call it Hardened Ferro. We out here gettin' shot at though called it living. That weird gel shit crawls around and realigns the metallic fibres, you can hear it crinkling' as it works.'

'''Mechs/EXT-6W'''

==Description==

The Exterminator is a BattleMech that was designed in 2630 for the most dubious, but necessary, of purposes: Headhunting. Advanced systems allowed it to easily infiltrate enemy lines. Once the Exterminator had breached the enemy's rear, its mission was to find and destroy as much of the enemy's command structure as possible. This mission profile included attacking Mobile Headquarters, field bases and command level officers. Rather than be part of the standard formation, Exterminators were attached to a regimental or higher headquarters unit, often as a fifth member of the command lance itself, before being assigned to individual units.

'''Mechs/FLS-8KK'''

==Description==

The personal 'Mech of David Kalasa, the Founding Khan of Clan Sea Fox, later renamed to Clan Diamond Shark. He was killed piloting it during Operation KLONDIKE, and while his 'Mech was recovered afterwards it somehow got "misplaced" during transport back from the battlefield. The 'Mech was heavily converted to use Clan tech, being able to convert all the lasers to Extended Range variants and still improve the cooling capbilities.

'''Mechs/FLS-C'''

==Description==

Produced by the Draconis Combine in 3063, this variant was based on the 8K models they received as part of Operation Rosebud. The only difference with this variant is the removal of the flamer to carry a C3 Slave Unit.

'''Mechs/FLS-9M'''

==Description==

This second Word of Blake variant, introduced in 3070 and built for House Marik forces loyal to the Blakists, is less flashy than the 9B but still effective. Like that variant, the 9M utilizes an Endo Steel chassis and a Light Engine, although it is a smaller engine with a top speed of 64 km/h to enable this Flashman to mount paired Heavy PPCs. Unfortunately its heat dissipation system is strained to the limit just to keep up with the powerful cannons. Up close, four medium lasers and four medium pulse lasers deliver withering firepower, while the addition of a Small Laser seems an afterthought.

==Description==

The first variant produced by Word of Blake in 3068 following their conquest of Hesperus II, the 9B utilizes a Light Fusion Engine, Compact Gyro, Endo Steel structure, Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, and a Small Cockpit. Twelve double heat sinks struggle to cool the all-laser configuration. Two ER Large Lasers enable the Flashman to strike from long distances. Two ER Medium Lasers, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and an ER Small Laser are powerful up close. A C3i Computer enables the 9B to share targeting telemetry with other, like-equipped units.

'''Mechs/FLS-8K'''

==Description==

The Flashman is an underrated heavy 'Mech, commonly called a "flashbulb" by MechWarriors for its heavy-energy configuration. The Flashman, which was first introduced in 2701, is a 'Mech that is capable of engaging an enemy for extended periods of time with little re-supply. The primary weapons on the Flashman FLS-8K are three Large Lasers mounted in the right arm, left arm, and center torso. These are backed up by five Medium Lasers, two mounted in either arm coaxial to the large lasers, two in the left torso and one in the right. The Flashman also carries an Anti-Missile System with one ton of ammo in the right torso to defend against missile attacks, and a Flamer in the head, to deter infantry attacks. The use of a Faust/Shinji AT/TS targeting-tracking system gives the Flashman a level of accuracy few can match, while fifteen double heat sinks give it an effective heat management system. The 'Mech is also notable for using an extralight engine which makes it fast for its size, though not at the expense of protection thanks to thirteen and a half tons of armor.

'''Mechs/FLS-7K'''

==Description==

A far cry from the fast and deadly 8K Flashman, the 7K model is a downgraded version that was produced by Defiance Industries in 2796 after the destruction of the Renault-Prime factories, using a blueprint that was acquired prior to the factory's destruction. The advanced extralight engine was no longer being produced though, and with a standard Vlar 300 the design now has a top speed of only 64.8 km/h. In addition, the center torso Large Laser, the AMS and the advanced targeting-tracking system were also removed and the double heat sinks replaced with standard single versions. The design now instead only carries two arm-mounted Large Lasers and five Medium Lasers. Surprisingly, the armor protection has not been sacrificed in any way, which has resulted in the 7K being more durable than the SLDF version due to its lack of an XL engine.

'''Mechs/GLH-3D'''

==Description==

This custom variant of the Galahad was used by Phantom Demi-Precentor Delta Laodices, a commander of the 40th Shadow Division. It uses a Small Cockpit, an Improved C3 Computer, one Light Gauss Rifle, and a Guardian ECM Suite - just like a standard 3D Galahad. It differs, however, in that it drops the other Light Gauss Rifle and one ton of ammunition, replacing them with an ER PPC enhanced by an experimental PPC Capacitor in the right arm. In addition, a Light PPC is mounted in the center torso. These modifications allow the 'Mech to remain in combat for far longer.

'''Mechs/GLH-3D'''

==Description==

Born from the Terran Hegemony's attempts to create a medium fire-support platform that would be more advanced than the RLN-1N Rifleman, Mitchell Vehicles unveiled the GLH-1D Galahad in 2570. Though it outgunned the earlier design and found significant acceptance within the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Galahad suffered from the same heat issues as the BattleMech it was meant to replace. The Word of Blake's version of the Galahad, the GLH-3D variant, employs a 240-rated Light Fusion Engine and a small cockpit. For weapons it uses two Light Gauss Rifles with four tons of ammo to split between them. It was also given more sophisticated electronics, in the way of an improved C3 computer and a Guardian ECM Suite.

'''Mechs/GLH-2D'''

==Description==

Born from the Terran Hegemony's attempts to create a medium fire-support platform that would be more advanced than the RLN-1N Rifleman, Mitchell Vehicles unveiled the GLH-1D Galahad in 2570. Though it outgunned the earlier design and found significant acceptance within the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Galahad suffered from the same heat issues as the BattleMech it was meant to replace. With the development of the new Gauss Rifle, Mitchell Vehicles decided in 2594 to redesign the Galahad around these new weapons. The Galahad utilizes special building materials in the form of eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and Endo Steel internals. To fit the massive weapons on the Galahad, the engine was dropped to a GM 180, giving it a maximum speed of only 54 km/h, making it difficult for the 'Mech to keep up with its companions in most cases. The GLH-2D carries two massive M-7 Gauss Rifles, with two tons of ammo for each rifle. It was a showing of the powerful new weapons at the time and earned it the nickname of Gausszilla.

'''Mechs/GTD-20S'''

==Description==

The Götterdämmerung is a Heavy class BattleMech first fielded by the Lyran Commonwealth in 3138, the 'Mech's German name translates to twilight of the gods or ragnarök. The Götterdämmerung's durability is due in part of layers of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous Armor, while Blackstone would move the cockpit of the 'Mech to the torso. The Torso-Mounted Cockpit's ejection system is highly complex, making escape from the Götterdämmerung difficult under certain circumstances. MechWarriors piloting the 'Mech need also be wary of losing their side torsos, due to the split placement of their life support systems.

'''Mechs/DRG-C'''

==Description==

Modified specifically to carry a C3 slave unit into combat, the C is a modification of the DRG-5K introduced in 3050. The 'Mech carries a C3 slave in the place of its rear-facing medium laser. While this does reduce the Grand Dragons short range firepower somewhat, it also makes the machine far more accurate when working in a C3 lance.

'''Mechs/DRG-5K'''

==Description==

The DGR-5K Grand Dragon introduced in 3050 incorporates a number of lostech improvements over the original DRG-1G.Mounted in its right arm is a Lord's Light 2 ER PPC. The ER PPC is backed up by a LRM-10 in the center torso, which gives the 'Mech an impressive and formidable long-range striking capability. The launcher is fed by a two-ton reload bin in the left torso protected by CASE. If an enemy 'Mech gets into close ranges, the Grand Dragon carries three Victory 23R Medium Lasers for defense, one in the left arm and two split between the rear-facing left and right torso. Protected by ten tons of armor, the Grand Dragon uses thirteen double heat sinks for excellent heat management and uses a 16.5 ton Hermes 360 XL engine to achieve a moderate cruising speed of 64 km/h.

==Description==

The Grand Summoner is a Heavy Class Clan OmniMech which was first produced by Clan Jade Falcon during the early years of the thirty-second century. Initially produced by the Eagle Craft Group on Erewhon in the Inner Sphere, the Grand Summoner(also known by the Clan as the Grand Summoner) proved to be a highly reliable replacement for the original Thor OmniMech. The design would soon be traded among other Inner Sphere Clans and became popular among their Warrior castes. One of the 'Mech's most noted actions was during Clan Wolf's Trial of Possession for then Clan Diamond Shark's entire Swimmer Khanate’s Beta Aimag. The flotilla’s commanders were able to bid down the Clan Wolf commander to a Cluster’s worth of forces on the world of Feltre. The Grand Summoner's performance in the hands of Diamond Shark MechWarriors in this difficult terrain helped to turn the tide of battle and resulted in winning the Trial. Clan Jade Falcon first produced the Grand Summoner as a distinct symbol of honor. This 'Mech is painted yearly in the parade scheme of a unit chosen by the Clan's Khan as part of tradition of honoring Clusters who had performed services honoring the Clan.

'''Mechs/GSMN-A'''

==Description==

The Grand Summoner is a Heavy Class Clan OmniMech which was first produced by Clan Jade Falcon during the early years of the thirty-second century. Initially produced by the Eagle Craft Group on Erewhon in the Inner Sphere, the Grand Summoner(also known by the Clan as the Grand Summoner) proved to be a highly reliable replacement for the original Thor OmniMech. The design would soon be traded among other Inner Sphere Clans and became popular among their Warrior castes. One of the 'Mech's most noted actions was during Clan Wolf's Trial of Possession for then Clan Diamond Shark's entire Swimmer Khanate’s Beta Aimag. The flotilla’s commanders were able to bid down the Clan Wolf commander to a Cluster’s worth of forces on the world of Feltre. The Grand Summoner's performance in the hands of Diamond Shark MechWarriors in this difficult terrain helped to turn the tide of battle and resulted in winning the Trial. Clan Jade Falcon first produced the Grand Summoner as a distinct symbol of honor. This 'Mech is painted yearly in the parade scheme of a unit chosen by the Clan's Khan as part of tradition of honoring Clusters who had performed services honoring the Clan.

'''Mechs/GHR-MJ'''

==Description==

Based on the personal Grasshopper of Tor Miraborg, the Mjölnir is primarily armed with a PPC in the right arm and Gauss Rifle on the left arm, retaining the GHR-5H's jump jets, side torso mounted Medium and center torso mounted Large Lasers. Built around a fragile 280 rated XL Engine, an Endo Steel frame and near maximum standard armor, three tons of Gauss rounds and thirteen double heat sinks give Mjölnir more than adequate field endurance.

==Description==

The customized Grasshopper used by 3rd Davion Guards Hauptmann Reynolds Allen when he commanded the Allen's Animals raiding company during Operation Bird Dog. To help him hold out against Clan Smoke Jaguar forces on Luzerne, this 'Mech's standard weapons were replaced with a trio of Clan-Tech ER large lasers mounted in the head and center torso supported by a Clan ER Medium Laser mounted in each arm and side torso. The remaining free weight was devoted to IS-grade double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/GHR-C'''

==Description==

A basic modification of the 5J model introduced by the Combine in 3052, the Grasshopper-C carries a C3 slave unit to allow it to be integrated into a C3 lance. These models often served as the point 'Mech in a C3 lance, where its speed and armor allowed it to get close enough to the enemy and share this targeting data with friendly units. To make room for the addition of the C3 unit, ammunition for the Streak SRM-2 launcher was reduced by one ton, though since the Streak launcher was already an ammo-efficient design this resulted in no drop in performance

==Description==

Taking inspiration from the original Grasshopper 5H, the 8K is a Dark Age redesign of the Grasshopper that reinvents it as a long ranged skirmisher and raider. Armed with 4 LPPC’s and an ER Large Laser, the 8K retains the 5H’s head mounted LRM-5; albeit with the inclusion of CAE II to protect the ammo bay.

'''Mechs/GHR-7KG'''

==Description==

Piloted by Major Aaron Pollyea during the resistance to the Word of Blake's occupation of New Avalon, this Grasshopper variant was a captured Kuritan 7K prototype which had undergone testing and modification at the NAIS. The C3 slave module and ER medium laser were removed, allowing a pair of medium pulse laser to be mounted in the center torso, while the Guardian ECM had to be moved to the left torso. The use of Triple-Strength Myomer turned this 'Mech into an extremely dangerous brawler, while fourteen double heat sinks still kept it cool and allowed it to activate the TSM. Major Pollyea terrorized local Word units in his matte-black Gravedigger, ambushing patrols and leading commando-style raids against "the robes.

'''Mechs/GHR-7K'''

==Description==

An upgrade of the 6K introduced in 3068, the 7K replaces the weapons with an eye toward making the Grasshopper independent of supply concerns common during the Jihad. Two arm-mounted Light PPCs provide long-range firepower, while short-range firepower is provided by twin torso-mounted Snub-Nose PPCs. A head-mounted ER Medium Laser takes the place of the 6K's Streak launcher, while the addition of a Guardian ECM Suite and C3 slave unit makes this Grasshopper a difficult-to-detect guerrilla fighter.

'''Mechs/GHR-6K'''

==Description==

The 6K variant of the Grasshopper was introduced by LexaTech Industries of Hun Ho in 3064. Upgrading the design by using an Endo Steel chassis and seventeen double heat sinks, it is armed with an ER large laser and five Medium Pulse Lasers. The LRM-5 launcher has also been replaced with a Guided Technologies 2nd Generation Streak SRM-4 missile launcher fed by a ton of ammunition protected by CASE, while a C3 slave unit allows it to share targeting data with friendly units

'''Mechs/GHR-5N'''

==Description==

The 5N is a very basic field upgrade of the Grasshopper introduced around 3040. The large laser and missile launcher have both been removed and in their place was added a PPC and a fifth medium laser respectively. Though the change increases the design's firepower, it also comes at a greater risk of overheating the 'Mech, especially if the pilot is careless.

The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally. It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. Six Improved Jump Jets vault the Grigori D up to 180 meters. A Heavy and a Light PPC allow it to snipe effectively. Two ER Mediums and a pair of ER Smalls back up the PPCs in case an enemy gets under their minimum range.

Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. Unlike the rest of the Invictus variants of the Celestials, the Grigori's most common version is a missile-heavy 'Mech, armed with an MRM-20, LRM-15, and a Streak SRM-4. If it runs out of ammunition, the Grigori has a Light PPC and a Retractable Blade for close quarters combat.

Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. Another missile-heavy variant, the Grigori B mounts an Artemis IV-guided MML 7 in each arm. A Plasma Rifle provides respectable firepower and forces conventional units to reconsider attacking the Infernus variant. A Medium Pulse Laser provides a more accurate weapon. A rear-mounted ER Small Laser makes small units think twice about attacking the 'Mech's rear. Like the Invictus, this configuration can also jump up to 120 meters.

An ER PPC supplements its fire at range. If an enemy gets closer, the Grigori E can do more damage with five ER Medium Lasers and an ER Small.

Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. This variant uses four, torso-mounted jump jets to propel it up to one hundred twenty meters at a time. Its largest weapon is the Heavy PPC that can dish out as much damage as its Clan-tech counterpart. Up close, the Grigori Dominus uses paired ER Medium Lasers and Medium Pulse Lasers, as well as a head-mounted Streak SRM-6. A pair of extra double heat sinks keep heat levels manageable.

Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. This variant also jumps, though it also adds a Guardian ECM Suite for further defensive measures. Three MRM 10s aim to take advantage of the integral C3 network, while twin Streak SRM-6s spreads fire out all over an enemy target. Two ER Medium Lasers back up the missile weapons in case they run out of ammunition.

'''Mechs/HEC-6CM'''

==Description==

Built to command BC3 equipped lances, the Hecatoneires 6Cm is a minor upgrade to the 6C model. The Streak LRM-15 is downsied to a smaller SLRM-10 with the loss of a ton of ammo. The remaining ton is moved to a new ammo bay located below the cockpit, a source of consternation for some pilots. With the freed weight and space, a Boosted C3 Master computer is mounted in the Left torso.

'''Mechs/HEC-6C'''

==Description==

A 3050's era design, the Hecatoncheires is the FWL's attempt to produce a dedicated heavy scout suitable for the modern battlefield. Based on a previously rejected redesign of the venerable Cyclops, the Hecatoncheires downsizes the classic cyclops to 65 tons in weight. A Beagle Active probe, paired with a C3 unit make up the mechs specialist electronics.  4 Medium Lasers and a pair of SRM-6's with Artemis IV provide a nasty punch at close range, while a Gauss Rifle covers longer ranges.

An export model of the Hecatoncheires, the 4H was an unpopular faliure. Intended to complment the C3 lances, the 4H strips out the C3 and Probe to replace them with Jump Jets. A UAC/10 replaces the Gauss Rifle and Streak SRM's are mounted in place of the standard models. Whilst more mobile and possessing a heavier punch at close range, the design was unpopular with most of the production run sold to the Mercenary martket.

'''Mechs/HEC-4CM'''

==Description==

A 3050's era design, the Hecatoncheires is the FWL's attempt to produce a dedicated heavy scout suitable for the modern battlefield. Based on a previously rejected redesign of the venerable Cyclops, the Hecatoncheires downsizes the classic cyclops to 65 tons in weight. The 4-Cm is a command variant intended to lead lances of Hecatoncheires or other C3 equipped mechs in combat. Downsizing the SRM-6's to a pair of SRM-4's allows the C3 Slave to swapped out for a Master unit. The mech is otherwise the same as the standard configuration.

Based on a previously rejected redesign of the venerable Cyclops, the Hecatoncheires downsizes the classic cyclops to 65 tons in weight. A Beagle Active probe, paired with a C3 unit make up the mechs specialist electronics.  4 Medium Lasers and a pair of SRM-6's with Artemis IV provide a nasty punch at close range, while a Gauss Rifle covers longer ranges.

'''Mechs/HBRII-PRIME'''

==Description==

Developed prior to Gray Monday, the Loki Mk II is a Heavy Class OmniMech which was originally created for the touman of Clan Jade Falcon. Also known as the Hel internally among the Clans, the Loki is an upgraded version of the venerable Hellbringer developed by Clan Hell's Horses in 2926. The new 'Mech differs from its thirtieth century originator by having heavier equipment capacity and improved armor protection but a lower top speed. The 'Mech would become primarily used by Clans Jade Falcon and Hell's Horses in 3145, where the 'Mech would see action during those Clans' invasions of the Inner Sphere powers such as the Republic of the Sphere and Lyran Commonwealth. A noted action that utilized the Loki was during the Jade Falcon's occupation of Sargasso in 3142. The 9th Talon deployed a binary of Lokis to suppress resistance in the city of Salicastrum. The Cluster's Lokis (fitted with B Configurations) used their Long Tom Cannons to blast rebel forces. However, a Nova of Wolf-In-Exiles forces ambushed the binary, and the ensuing battle rendered half the Jade Falcon Lokis destroyed, however the survivors would withdraw temporarily. A Star's worth of survivors from the 9th would return to force a Clan Wolf retreat and prevent the world from falling back into Commonwealth hands.

'''Mechs/HEP-4H'''

==Description==

This variant was introduced much more recently by Vining Engineering and Salvage Team. VEST rebuilt a factory on Solaris VII after the Word of Blake had left that world. There, they began to produce an upgraded version of the Helepolis. This upgrade of the 3H is built on an Endo Steel frame. It is powered by a 300-rated Light Fusion Engine that gives it a top speed of 64 km/h, though this necessitated splitting the missile launcher into two LRM-5s.

'''Mechs/HEP-3H'''

==Description==

The Helepolis is built around an Armstrong Industries Sniper Artillery Piece. The accurate, long-range fire makes it effective against static defenses. The 'Mech does carry some backup weapons to augment its screening forces. It can defend itself with a Coventry Starfire LRM-10 and Nova Large Laser. If an enemy gets close, the MechWarrior can call upon a Thunderstroke SRM-6 and a Starflash Medium Laser. This 2625 model upgrades the Large Laser to an ER Large Laser.

'''Mechs/HEP-2H'''

==Description==

First unleashed by the Terran Hegemony in 2460, the Helepolis is a ponderous BattleMech designed to deliver artillery fire. The 'Mech was proven ineffective on multiple occasions and, following the destruction of the production facilities in 2775, the design was lost during the Succession Wars. The HEP-2H dates to 2488.

'''Mechs/HEP-1H'''

==Description==

The earliest version used standard heat sinks and its Primitive Engine could only manage 30 km/h. This proved to be a challenge as the early Helepolis needed to completely stop to fire the Sniper artillery and then start moving again before counter-battery fire could destroy the unit. Twenty and a half tons of Primitive Armor protected the Helepolis from enemy fire. The weight and bulk of the primitive systems prevented the designers from installing the long range missiles used on later models.

'''Mechs/HEP-0H'''

==Description==

The precursor to the 1H, the 0H was a flawed design that ran too hot and had insufficient armament or heat sinks for sustained combat. Armed with a Howitzer in place of the iconic Sniper piece, it lacks the range and stopping power of the later versions, whilst running significantly hotter due to the second large laser it mounted. Only a couple of test models were every introduced and the design was lost to the mists of history with the debut of the 1H and then the 2H, in 2480. Occasionally Helepolises in the periphery will be rebuilt along similar lines, the prized Sniper artillery pieces stripped off for other uses and local hardware retrofitted in its place.

'''Mechs/HLF-1'''

==Description==

Despite its initial success, the combat service of the Hellfire has not be flaw free. Aside from the sensor interference caused by firing its signature Heavy Lasers, a number of battlefield reports indicate the heavy laser tubes can violently rupture in the heat of battle. The 'Mech also experiences a fifteen percent higher rate of MASC failure than usual, though technicians have yet to determine whether this is due to the age of the Lupus chassis or if this is something caused by the Heavy Lasers.

==Description==

The second Clan Jade Falcon model trades mobility for raw firepower, removing the jump-jets, wing and supercharger to upgrade two of its arm-mounted lasers to ER Large Lasers and its four SRM launchers to ATM-6s, mounting an additional ER Small Laser as well. Carrying four tons of reloads, generally two tons of standard ATM missiles and one each of Extended Range and High Explosive give it reasonable field endurance.

==Description==

Clan Jade Falcon's version of the Jade Hawk is purely Clan-spec and lacks the advanced myomers and claws of the DOA JHK-03 model, carrying four Streak SRM-6 launchers instead of the standard models and mounting a Light Active Probe in its head. Four tons of ammo give the design excellent endurance despite the large number of launchers, while the addition of Ferro-Fibrous plating increases it protection.

==Description==

DOA's support model, JHK-04 drops the jump jets, partial wing, advanced myomers and supercharger in exchange for a pair of torso-mounted Streak LRM-15 launchers imported from the Sea Foxes. Three tons of reloads allow the pilot a decent combat radius, while the addition of IS-spec Heavy Duty Gyro and switch to Ferro-Fibrous armor offers a modest boost in protection.

==Description==

Relatively lightly armed for a heavy BattleMech, the Jade Hawk is equipped only with four Series 1g ER Small Lasers and a set of four Mk. 22 Type III SRM-6s, as well as the claws on its extremities, themselves impressive close combat weapons for Death from Above attacks and grappling with other 'Mechs in close combat conditions. This combination of melee and short ranged weaponry, heavy armor, and speed (rivaling 'Mechs a third of its tonnage) make the Jade Hawk a powerful close-in fighter and a force to be reckoned with in urban environments.

'''Mechs/JM6-E'''

==Description==

The 6-E replaces the standard Jagermech engine with a 260 rated Light Engine, allowing the installation of the new Stealth Armour and accompanying ECM suite. The Autocannons are replaced with HVAC models and 4 tons of ammo. The standard lasers are replaced with ER versions and the original single heat sinks remain unchanged. Solely fielded by the Capellan Confederation, this mech is rarely seen, with most of the production models simply vanishing into thin air once they leave the factory. Where they end up and when they will see action are questions yet to be answered.

A recent variant to the JagerMech, the JM6-B removes most of the ammunition dependencies of the original model by swapping out the AutoCannons for Lasers.  To make up for the loss in range, a pair of LRM-15 launchers have been added.

'''Mechs/JN-G9CC'''

==Description==

An advanced variant that emerged during the Jihad, the Jinggau's standard armor is replaced with Stealth Armor and the prerequisite Guardian ECM Suite, while the jump jets are replaced with MASC. The weaponry has also be significantly altered, a Snub-Nose PPC and Large Variable Speed Pulse Laser its main weaponry supported by with trio of Small VSP Lasers. To enhance its abilities, a Beagle Active Probe has added to the 'Mech's equipment, with standard Gyro has been removed for slightly more vulnerable XL Gyro to free up the weight required.

'''Mechs/JN-G8A'''

==Description==

The Jinggau is built on a lightweight Chariot Type II Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a VOX 325 XL engine that gives it a top speed of 86.4 km/h. To increase its mobility, the Jinggau has five Hellespont Leaper jump jets that allow it to jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. For protection, the Jinggau carries eleven and a half tons of armor that protects the 'Mech from enemy fire. To dissipate the waste heat produced by the Jinggau's weapons and jump jets, the 'Mech has thirteen double heat sinks that are more than adequate. Overall, with its high ground speed, superior mobility, armor, and firepower the Jinggau is a 'Mech more than capable of handling most enemies on today's battlefield. The primary weapon on the Jinggau is a powerful Zhi-tong-yao Gauss Rifle that gives the 'Mech a maximum striking distance of up to six hundred and sixty meters which allows the Jinggau the opportunity to draw the first blood on the battlefield. For close combat, the Jinggau has a set of four Diverse Optics Type ER Medium Lasers and a single, highly accurate, Raker-IV Medium Pulse Laser.

'''Mechs/LDK-5C'''

==Description==

The Loader King is one of the few IndustrialMechs still being manufactured in the Inner Sphere. This is due in large part to the fact that Achernar BattleMechs, the parent company of Achernar Heavy Industries, chose to maintain their IndustrialMech output rather than retool the lines for BattleMech production. Achernar BattleMechs already produces the Locust, Wasp, Phoenix Hawk and the Enforcer at their headquarters on New Avalon.

'''Mechs/LUPUS-PRIME'''

==Description==

The primary configuration of the Lupus replaces the Archer and Bombardier 'Mechs. A pair of LRM-20 launchers with improved Artemis IV guidance systems allows the warrior to destroy a foe before they can reach close range. The Lupus Prime also carries a set of jump jets which allowed a smart warrior the opportunity to hold the range open, bombarding the enemy with heavy missile barrages. The only drawback is the limited ammunition supply: A mere three tons of ammunition allows for only a brief engagement. Should the enemy close with the Lupus all is not lost. The ER Medium Laser in each arm allow the Lupus to slice off armor, and the ECM Suite makes the Lupus Prime more difficult to target.

==Description==

This configuration was used for direct fire support roles. A Large Pulse Laser in one arm supported an Ultra AC/10 in the other. A pair of ER Medium Lasers gave the Lupus A additional firepower in case the 'Mech went through all 30 reloads for the autocannon. Twelve double heat sinks kept the heat manageable.

==Description==

The Mad Dog's most distinctive feature is its side torso and arm pods, which are practically full modules by themselves, suggesting that the mech was conceived as a long-range support unit. The torso modules, angled high, are ideal for missiles while the arms serve as extended turrets suited for direct-fire weaponry.

'''Mechs/MDD-B'''

==Description==

The Mad Dog's most distinctive feature is its side torso and arm pods, which are practically full modules by themselves, suggesting that the mech was conceived as a long-range support unit. The torso modules, angled high, are ideal for missiles while the arms serve as extended turrets suited for direct-fire weaponry.

==Description==

This Marauder, commonly refered as the MAD-DER, was first seen as a Solaris VII speed boosted refit which boasts of an L.A.M. System incorporated to the very mech's chassis and engine, enabling it to go faster and actually fly in short bursts. Made with that kind of passion for a flying Marauder, the design was quickly stolen and reffited with several disabler weapons. Making it a capable fast heavy support class mech.

==Description==

A Clan-tech retrofit of the classic MAD-3R Marauder, designed for use by second-line garrison and solahma forces, the Marauder C replaced some of the Inner Spheroid weaponry with Clan equivalents. The Marauder C swapped the PPCs for a pair of Clan-tech Large Pulse Lasers and the standard autocannon for a Ultra AC/5 model, but retained the IS medium lasers. The munitions for the autocannon were also protected with CASE.

'''Mechs/MAD-BH-II'''

==Description==

The Bounty Hunter upgraded his Marauder sometime in 3044. The fusion engine was upgrade to an extra-light version while keeping it at the same rating to save weight, though the increased size meant three heat sinks had to be removed. The standard PPCs were upgrade to ER PPCs, both the left and right torso-mounted medium lasers were removed while the center torso medium laser was moved to the head to make room for a Gauss Rifle on the right torso and two tons of ammunition. This upgrade allowed the Bounty Hunter to engage enemies at a far greater range while still able to continuously operate without fear of overheating.

==Description==

This unusual variant piloted by the Bounty Hunter featured various lostech equipment: the standard 300 Vlar fusion engine was downgrade to a 225-rated version giving it a top speed of 54 kph. It mounted a standard PPC and a Medium Laser in each arm while another PPC and medium laser were mounted on the right torso; additional medium lasers were mounted in the center and left torso. Sixteen double heat sinks were use to cool this beast down, allowing it to firing all 3 PPCs without even generating excess heat. It featured fourteen and a half tons of standard armor, giving it maximum armor for it's weight, and was capable of jumping over 90 meters with three jump jets. It was also painted all green with credit symbols.

'''Mechs/MAD-9S'''

==Description==

The Marauder was first built by General Motors in 2612 for use as an attack and direct fire support BattleMech. The first 'Mech to diverge from the traditional humanoid shape of previous machines, the Marauder was one of the most well-known 'Mechs in existence and originally meant to usher in a new generation of 'Mechs. Unfortunately, with the fall of the Star League, this new generation never quite materialized. On its own merits though, the Marauder was a devastatingly powerful 'Mech, outclassed only by larger machines like the Stalker and BattleMaster.

'''Mechs/MAD-5S'''

==Description==

The 5S variant of the Marauder dates to the Clan Invasion, introduced in 3051 by Bowie Industries after the Draconis Combine captured plans for the 5D design. The variant was built around an XL engine to save weight and upgraded the heat sinks to double-strength models. Like the 5D, the 5S carried ER PPCs and medium pulse lasers, but replaced the autocannon with a Gauss Rifle. One ton of ammunition for this powerful, long-ranged weapon was carried in the left torso.

'''Mechs/MAD-5M'''

==Description==

The 5M variant of the Marauder was introduced in 3051 by Ronin Inc. and Free Worlds Defense Industries for the Free Worlds League. Compared to the original it replaced the standard fusion engine with an XL Engine and completely re-armed the 'Mech with recovered Star League-era weapons. The primary weapons were two Large Pulse Lasers, backed up by two Medium Pulse Lasers, in either arm. Finally, in place of the Autocannon/5, the 5M carried a LB-X Autocannon/10. The 5M had a jumping distance of up to one hundred and twenty meters thanks to four jump jets mounted in the legs and carried sixteen double heat sinks. One ton of ammunition for the LB-X was carried in the left torso and protected by CASE.

'''Mechs/MAD-4X'''

==Description==

This experimental variant was made at Ronin Incorporated's facility on Wallis in 3039. Techs removed the standard weaponry from a Marauder and replaced the arm mounted weapons with a Binary Laser Cannon in each arm, while the torso mounted autocannon was replaced by twin SRM-6 launchers backed by one ton of ammunition. The Marauder-4X was also noteworthy because it used a Prototype Endo Steel chassis. To keep the heat under control, technicians installed twelve single heat sinks and six prototype Double Heat Sinks.

'''Mechs/MAD-4S'''

==Description==

Designed and constructed during the Jihad, the 4S updated the design of the popular 3S series of Marauders with new technology designed to improve it’s effectiveness on the modern battlefield. Built around 18 Double Heat Sinks, the 4S has similar design principles to it’s predecessor; designed for ease of maintenance and repair. With an extra ton of armour and a targeting computer, it is capable of taking a heavier pounding at close range and boasts superior accuracy at mid to long range. Aside from this it is functionally similar to it’s predecessor, retaining the medium laser and ppc loadout; though the PPC’s have been updated to ER versions and the old single heat sinks swapped for more efficient double heat sinks. Production has been brisk, with General Motors taking orders from across the Inner Sphere and the Periphery; as mercenaries and planetary militias look to upgrade the older Marauders in their arsenals.

'''Mechs/MAD-3S'''

==Description==

Built for the budget conscious mercenary, the 3S is designed for prolonged operations and utilises an all energy loadout that is cheaper to maintain than the standard 3R; whilst using widely available components cuts down on repair costs. The maintenance intensive Autocannon and it’s infamously bad ammunition feed are replaced with an extra trio of Medium Lasers and 6 heat sinks, dramatically increases the amount of time the mech can go without resupply. The extra heat sinking helps offset the increased heat profile added by the lasers, whilst the increased number of medium lasers act as a strong deterrent to any lighter mechs seeking to get inside the PPC’s firing arc. Debuting in 2955, production has remained steady; with two dozen of these machines being built a year at the General Motors Kathil facility. Sold exclusively to the mercenary market, the 3S is a common site on worlds like Outreach and Galatia and remains a favourite of mercenaries everywhere despite it's age.

'''Mechs/MAD-3R'''

==Description==

The Marauder was first built by General Motors in 2612 for use as an attack and direct fire support BattleMech. The first 'Mech to diverge from the traditional humanoid shape of previous machines, the Marauder was one of the most well-known 'Mechs in existence and originally meant to usher in a new generation of 'Mechs. Unfortunately, with the fall of the Star League, this new generation never quite materialized. On its own merits though, the Marauder was a devastatingly powerful 'Mech, outclassed only by larger machines like the Stalker and BattleMaster.

'''Mechs/MAD-3M'''

==Description==

The 3M was introduced in 2873 specially for the Free Worlds League. Because of the abundance of large lasers built by that realm, the 3M model carried two large lasers in place of the PPCs. While running cooler than the weapons they replaced, the large lasers also caused slightly less damage. Additionally, the 3M added four heat sinks to the design, making the 'Mech much more manageable for pilots who have trouble with overheating their 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/MAD-3L'''

==Description==

Built for House Liao in 2905, the 3L attempted to make the Marauder more heat efficient (and make up for a shortage in reliable PPCs) by replacing one of the arm-mounted particle cannons with a large laser. Additionally, two more heat sinks were added to further increase the Marauder's heat efficiency.

'''Mechs/MAD-3D'''

==Description==

The 3D Marauder was a modification of the 'Mech introduced for House Davion in 2834 which removed its ammunition dependency. In order to do this, the 3D replaced the Autocannon/5 and with a Large Laser. The saved weight was used to add four more heat sinks to the 'Mech to handle the added heat burden from the large laser.

==Description==

The Marauder-2R is the Star League Royal regiments variant of the classic and powerful Marauder. It makes minimal changes, simply upgrading the PPCs to ER PPCs and the heat sinks to doubles, but those changes are enough to give the -2R much better staying and hitting power.

==Description==

The Marauder is among the most classic of all Mech designs, venerable, powerful, respected. However, the original Marauder, the -1R, is mostly forgotten today. Clad in Ferro-Fibroous armor, it is otherwise the same as the downgraded -3R and is just as formidable.

'''Mechs/MLN-SX'''

==Description==

An experimental variant of the Merlin created by the FedSuns' Sabanillas Mining Company in 3075 under the direction of retired FedSun Major Caleb Gruber,who used his company to produce three of these modified Merlins. Gruber had the Merlin's internal structured strengthened by installing Endo-Composite Internal Structure and switching out the Standard Fusion Engine for a Lighter version. The weapons were swapped for a pair of Blakist tech Medium VSP Lasers and a Bombast Laser. Laser Insulators and 14 Double Heat Sinks keep the immense heat burden under control.

'''Mechs/MLN-2A'''

==Description==

A prototype that never saw widespread adoption, the Merlin 2A was Mountain Wolfs next generation offering unveiled alongside the 1B variant in 3053. Built around a 240 rated XL Engine, it is armed with a pair of ER Large Lasers and a pair of Medium Pulses. The 1A's Machine Gun is retained and the LRM-5 upgraded to a LRM-10. The addition of CASE protects the ammunition bays and 14 Double Heat Sinks handle the increased heat burden. At almost 19 million CBills, the design was rejected as too expensive and too reliant on advanced technology that the Outworlds Alliance struggled to produce. Mountain Wolf shelved the design, though not before a single run of 20 2A's were produced. Most of these were fielded by the Mountain Wolf security team, but some found their way into the hands of the elite Avellar Guard.

==Description==

A DCMS variant, this refit package is a series of field upgrades given to captured or salvaged Merlins. Found mainly along the Kuritan border with the Outworlds Alliance, the 1X upgrades the Merlin to modern technology. A combination of Double Heatsinks and Ferro Fibrous provide enough free weight to upgrade the PPC to a Heavy variant. The arm mounted Lasers are augmented by a pair of LPPC's and the remaining weapons are torn out in favour of a Medium Pulse Laser.

Designed as a close range brawler, the Merlin 1E is marketed to smaller periphery states and mercenary commands in the market for a cut price heavy mech. Replacing the traditional PPC with an AC/10 and removing the anti personel weapons, allows for an extra pair of Medium Lasers to be added.With a third less heatsinks than the usual Merlin designs, pilots will need to be careful with their heat or risk a premature ammo explosion.

'''Mechs/MLN-1B1'''

==Description==

A field modification of the Merlin 1A, the 1B1 removes the Machine Gun and Flamer of the 1A and replaces them with an additional pair of medium lasers. Hotter running then the regular 1A or 1B designs, it nonetheless packs a greater punch at close range and is a favourite configuration for pilots assigned to long range reconnaissance or raiding operations.

'''Mechs/MLN-1AR'''

==Description==

An unofficial refit kit that incorporates Star League era technology, the Merlin 1Ar never entered mainstream production but was a common upgrade if the parts could be obtained. The 1A's standard PPC  is swapped for an Extended Range version, whilst the Medium Lasers are exchanged for Pulse versions. To handle the extra heat load and free up the weight needed for the Pulses, double heatsinks are added to the design. With the excess free weight, the LRM-5 is upgraded to a LRM-10.

'''Mechs/MLN-1A1'''

==Description==

A rare variant of the Merlin, the 1A1 is a rebuild that strips out the expensive lasers and replaces them with cooler running Chemical alternatives. With the reduced heat burden, the LRM-5 is upgraded to an LRM-15 and a second ton of lrm ammo is added. Only seen among the poorer parts of the Periphery, it's increased ammo dependency makes it a poor choice in anything other than a defensive role.

'''Mechs/MLN-1A'''

==Description==

Released in 3010, the Merlin was the first original design to be manufactured in over a century. Designed by mountain Wolf Battlemechs as a durable and easy to repair mech, the Merlin is powered by a 240 rated fusion engine. Clad in 10 and a half tons of standard armor, it carries 18 heatsinks and a varied weapons load, designed to engage an enemy at any range. A PPC and LRM-5 launcher provide long range firepower, with a pair of medium lasers covering the shorter ranges. Also installed a machine gun and a flamer to guard against infantry attacks.

'''Mechs/MS-1A'''

==Description==

The Mortis was designed by the branches of StarCorps Industries in the Capellan Confederation and the Free Worlds League. A fast heavy 'Mech, the Mortis has thirteen tons of armor, a jump radius of 150 meters, and a top speed of 86km/h. The Mortis places its main weaponry in the arms. The five ton Hatchet carried in the right arm is excellent for delivering a crushing blow in physical combat, while the Heavy PPC in the left arm is useful for punching holes in an opponent's armor. To harass enemy forces while closing to the short range preferred by Mortis pilots, the right torso carries a single MML-5 with a two ton magazine. To provide a little more firepower, the center torso boasts a Rocket Launcher 10.

'''Mechs/NTG-PRIME'''

==Description==

The primary configuration is hard-hitting, mounting a pair of ER PPCs located in the left arm and an Ultra Autocannon/10 in the right. This blistering firepower can often take down an opponent before they are in range. Three Medium Pulse Lasers serve as accurate backups. Eight additional double heat sinks keep the 'Mech fairly cool.

This missile boat carries four LRM-20 launchers, each of which is slaved to an Artemis IV FCS. Six tons of ammunition is barely enough to keep it firing for a minute. A Large Pulse Laser and Medium Pulse Laser are effective backup weapons.

'''Mechs/NTG-B'''

==Description==

The Night Gyr B seeks to destroy opponents before they can return fire. A pair of Gauss Rifles and LB-X Autocannon/2s carry out that mandate. Ammo is somewhat lacking, however, so this design cannot stray far from supply, especially as it has no backup energy weapons.

'''Mechs/NJT-EMP'''

==Description==

The Ninja-To is intended to work with, and take advantage of, other units which carry a C3 Master Computer by carrying a C3 slave unit that allows it to share targeting data with other units in a C3 equipped unit. The Ninja-To is built on a lightweight Star League XT Light Endo Steel that cradles a powerful Magna 390 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 97.2 km/h, more when TSM is activated. While this combination of structure and engine saves weight, it also makes the Ninja-To susceptable to being a combat loss from side torso destruction. The 4emp Variant is a close range in-fighter packing dual Snub-Nose PPCs, ER Medium Lasers and Medium Pulse lasers as well as TSM for that up close and personal touch.

==Description==

The newer 2KO was designed to be even more lethal up-close than the 2K. This variant removes the MRMs entirely and changes the Large Laser to a Large Pulse Laser. An additional Medium Pulse Laser and Small Pulse Laser were added, as well as a Flamer and three more double heat sinks. A ton and a half of armor has been added to the 'Mech's rear to provide addition protection as has a pair of ER Medium Lasers.

'''Mechs/NDA-1K'''

==Description==

The No-Dachi was designed by Cosby as a test bed for two new technologies. The first was the Sword. The seven-meter long katana that the 'Mech wields was designed to counter the Hatchet used by some Federated Commonwealth 'Mechs. Because the samurai mindset had been so successfully drilled into the warriors of the Draconis Combine, they were loathe to use a ''barbaric'' ax. The second new technology was the Triple Strength Myomer that had been pioneered by the Federated Suns. The new melee weapon, combined with the improved myomers, make the No-Dachi a dangerous in-fighter.

'''Mechs/ON1-V-DC'''

==Description==

Command Console refit built in 2913 - Standard refits usually installed the Command Console on a ON1-V, requiring the removal of one ton of SRM, LRM, and AC ammunition. The loss of ammunition reduces its capability to maintain fire for long, but a Commander will typically not be located at the head of a formation.

==Description==

Instead of sacrificing armor, the Orion VA trades out some of it's long range punch by removing the LRM-15.  This allows it to not only maintain the stock armor, but also add 6 Heat Sinks for better heat management.

'''Mechs/ON1-H'''

==Description==

Built by General Mechanics, the ON1-H was the third known primitive prototype of the Orion 'Mech that was eventually accepted for mass production in 2456. While slower than the first iterations, with a top speed of only 54 km/h (the same as that of a Mackie or Banshee), due to the inclusion of a smaller 275-class engine, the additional weight saved allowed the designers to mount far more firepower. A newly developed Class-10 Prototype Autocannon was installed and two tons of ammo in place of the AC/5. This was backed up by two 5-tube Long-Range Missile launchers with one ton of reloads in the left torso for striking enemies at range and a short-range SRM-4 missile launcher and a ton of ammunition installed in the left arm for close-in defense. It was also heavily protected by 21 tons of armor. A minimal amount of heatsinks, however, could cause build-up of heat within crippling levels, but could be avoided by competent MechWarriors.

'''Mechs/ON1-C'''

==Description==

The original primitive Orion 'Mech as it was first commissioned lacked an LRM launcher and used an Autocannon/5 in place of the AC/10.  A massive 360 engine allowed the 'Mech to obtain a maximum speed of nearly 64.8 km/h, however there was not enough saved weight to mount additional weaponry besides two Medium Lasers, one in each arm. In addition it only mounted 14.5 tons of armor, and ultimately would be considered too lightly armed and armored with the prototype dismissed as a candidate for production.

'''Mechs/ON1-IIC-SK'''

==Description==

Reportedly piloted by Star Colonel Jaela Ward, the Orion IIC Hero 'Mech retains the right torso mounted Gauss Rifle unchanged but swaps the LRM rack for an ER PPC, upgrades the SRM-4 rack with Artemis IV FCS and downgrades the arm lasers to ER Medium Lasers. Carrying three tons of Gauss rounds and two of SRM reloads, the weight saved allows the mounting of two extra double heat sinks and MASC.

'''Mechs/ON1-IIC-C'''

==Description==

Since it was the chosen BattleMech of the Great Father, the venerable Orion has always held a special place in the mystique of the Clans. Out of respect for General Kerensky's legacy, all the Clans maintained the design for several decades even as the development of newer and more advanced technologies increasingly left it less effective on the battlefield. Not a radical reworking of the design, as some Clan upgrades are, the Orion IIC replaces much of the innards and weapons of the original, while preserving its mass and aesthetics. This IIC upgrade utilizes an Endo Steel chassis and twelve tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, while also making use of twelve double heat sinks, freeing up weight for heavier weapons loadout. This variant switches the Gauss Rifle to an Ultra Autocannon/10 and downgrading the LRM-20 rack into an LRM-15.

==Description==

The customized Orion IIC piloted by Knight of the Sphere Burton Davion at time of death during the Capellan Crusades removes all weaponry save the ER Large Lasers, swapping the SRM launcher for a Streak LRM-15, the torso mounted-LRM rack for an ATM-3 and the Gauss Rifle for a HAG/20, two tons of ammunition carried for each weapon. Burton's 'Mech used a XL Engine to free up the weight for this weaponry as well four Jump Jets and a Light Active Probe.

==Description==

An upgrade of the 4L, the 5W was produced by Kressly Warworks for the Word of Blake starting in 3070. It uses Kallon Unity Weave Ferro-Fibrous armor, a Defiance Light Engine, and a Small Cockpit to save weight. It uses a Compact Gyro to save space. The ER Large Lasers are replaced with Ceres Arms Thrasher Snub-Nose PPCs, while the ER Medium Lasers are essentially the same, but Diverse Optics models instead. Instead of the ECM, the 5W carries an Improved C3 Computer in the head.

'''Mechs/OSR-4L'''

==Description==

A complete redesign of the Ostroc, the 4L carries the best technology the Capellan Confederation has to offer in 3067. It uses an Ceresplex Ostroc Light Endo Steel chassis to carry two Martell ER Large Lasers and two Ceres Arms ER Medium Lasers split between the side torsos. Five HildCo 13 jump jets split between the side and center torsos gives it a jumping distance of 180 meters. Finally, the 4L Ostroc has a Guardian ECM Suite for electronics warfare use and also to work with ten and a half tons of Stealth Armor which makes it extremely difficult to hit. While it was originally suppose to use only standard armor, the addition of stealth capabilities makes this variant well suited for operating as a member of Capellan Shadow Lances. For electronics the Ostroc carries the Ceres Metals Model 686 and Ceres Bullseye systems.

'''Mechs/OSR-4K'''

==Description==

This version was introduced by House Kurita in 3077. A Heavy Duty Gyro allows it to stay in the fight longer, making good use of twin Snub-Nose PPCs and ER Medium Lasers. Though it's slightly slower than the standard Ostroc, jump jets allow it to maneuver around the battlefield, striking where it will inflict the most damage. After the Jihad ended, this model went into factory production.

'''Mechs/OSR-4C'''

==Description==

A Periphery variant of the Ostroc produced by Vandenburg Mechanized on New Vandenburg, the 4C is strikingly similar to the Capellan's 4L variant. It's armor has been upgraded with nine tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, giving it more protection than previous models. Additionally, the SRM-4 launcher has been removed in favor of two Rocket Launcher 10s and two Rocket Launcher 15s, giving the 'Mech an incredible one-shot damage capability.

'''Mechs/OSR-2X'''

==Description==

The custom 'Mech of Major Kira Tang, the Ostroc OSR-2X, is a full rebuild of the original mech. Sporting 4 Medium Pulse Lasers, 2 Small Lasers, a NARC and a supercharged 360 XL fusion engine, this 'Mech is in fact a lot deadlier than it seems at first glance. Using Endo-Steel structure and Ferro-Fibrous armor still leaves room for a MASC and both a Beagle Active Probe and a Guardian ECM Suite.

'''Mechs/OSR-2M'''

==Description==

An experimental model produced by Kong Interstellar for the Free Worlds League in 2793, the 2M variant of the Ostroc focuses on the 'Mech's maneuverability. Five jump jets, two in each leg and one in the rear torso, have been added to the design, giving it a maximum jumping distance of one hundred and fifty meters. In order to make this change, the medium lasers and the SRM-4 launcher were removed. Relatively few of these were built between the League's annexation of Connaught and the factory's destruction.

'''Mechs/OSR-2D'''

==Description==

Upgraded with Star League technology, the 2D variant of the Ostroc extends the 'Mechs maximum range by replacing the Large Lasers with two ER Large Lasers. The 2D retains the Medium Lasers and SRM-4 of the 2C model. To handle the heat burden it is also equipped with double heat sinks. Being a relatively rare design, the Ostroc had no official field refit kit but the 2D variant was a common upgrade in 3050 if the parts could be obtained.

'''Mechs/OSR-2C'''

==Description==

The Ostroc carries as its primary weapons two Fuersturm-C Large Lasers in the left and right torsos. These give the Ostroc good medium to long range damage capabilities. The Ostrocs secondary weapons are two Fuersturm-b Medium Lasers also mounted in the side torsos and a Totschlagen SRM-4 launcher in the right torso for close-range combat, with one ton of reloads carried in the center torso. While the Ostroc's laser-heavy weapons payload allows it to operate well as a guerrilla fighter since it has limited dependency on supply lines, its short arms are a handicap in close combat, and the shocks of hand-to-hand fighting can easily damage the Fuersturm systems.

'''Mechs/OSR-9C'''

==Description==

The Ostroc Mk II swaps the SRM-4 for one SRM-2 launcher in each side torso, with one ton of ammunition in the center torso. Half a ton of armor was added to the front torso and legs (adding one point to each leg and side torso, and four to center torso), and four more heat sinks were installed along with three jump jets for a jump capacity of 90 meters. To make room for these components, the engine had to be changed to a Pitban 240, reducing the top speed to 64.8 km/h.

'''Mechs/OTL-9R'''

==Description==

Built in 3077 after Kong Interstellar's production lines were damaged, this Ostsol version has a top speed of only 54 km/h. Installing a standard Fusion Engine, Heavy Duty Gyro, and maximizing the armor protection the 9R carries allows it to function in roles normally assigned to Assault 'Mechs. The addition of Triple Strength Myomer (and just enough heat sinks to keep the TSM active) also allows the 9R to inflict damage during the physical combat frequently encountered on Jihad battlefields. To cover its approach, this Ostsol uses a Heavy PPC, large laser, and Snub-Nose PPC. For close-in fighting the MechWarrior can use an ER medium laser, ER small laser, or standard small laser. The head-mounted C3 Slave allows the Ostsol to use targeting data from friendly units.

'''Mechs/OTL-9M'''

==Description==

Based on the 8M version of the Ostsol this version from 3079 removes the Triple Strength Myomer and uses a battery of ER large and ER medium lasers to damage a foe at long range. For close combat it carries a Snub-Nose PPC and medium pulse laser. In addition to its heavy armor, it uses a Guardian ECM Suite to disrupt enemy electronics and a MASC system to engage and disengage at will.

'''Mechs/OTL-8M'''

==Description==

The 8M Ostsol was built by the Free Worlds League in 3066 using the same Endo Steel chassis as the 7M, adding a larger 360-rated extralight engine to boost the 'Mech's speed to 97.2 kph. The 'Mech is similar, though, to the intended design philosophy of the original version, using Triple Strength Myomer to boost its top speed to 118.8 kph, and it carries a PPC as its primary weapon. This is supported by a large pulse laser, two medium pulse lasers, an ER Small Laser, and an ER medium laser.

'''Mechs/OTL-8D'''

==Description==

This variant of the 6D, introduced in 3069, replaces that version's pulse lasers and large lasers with a Light PPC and a pair of Light Autocannon/5s. The weight savings allows the use of a Light Fusion Engine instead of the bulky extra-light version. The extra heat sinks of the 6D were no longer needed, so they were removed. In order to save even more weight, a new Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor weave is used on this design, as is a small cockpit. The empty arms retain their hands, though the lack of heat buildup dictated the removal of the advanced myomers, making physical attacks less effective. A sizable CASE-protected ammunition bin in each side torso allows the use of different types of ammunition with the two light autocannons.

==Description==

The 7M steps outside the Ostsols design philosophy of independent operations. Introduced in 3065 the 'Mech is built around an Endo Steel chassis, and uses an extralight engine for power, though it only carries ten double heat sinks. The primary weapons are two Light Gauss Rifles and four ER Medium Lasers. Finally, CASE has been added to protect against a catastrophic failure of either of the Light Gauss Rifles.

'''Mechs/OTL-6D'''

==Description==

A complete redesign of the Ostsol unveiled in 3064, the 6D is powered by a GM 300 XL engine and is built using triple strength myomer, which push the 'Mech's top speed to 97.2 kph when operating in its optimum heat range. Carrying fourteen double heat sinks, the 'Mech is protected with eleven and a half tons of StarGuard Ferro-Fibrous armor. The weapons payload of the 6D consists of two Diverse Optics ER Large Lasers, two Diverse Optics ER Medium Lasers, two Magna 600P Medium Pulse Lasers, and two Magna 200P Small Pulse Lasers. The extended-range lasers are split between the side torsos, the medium pulses split between right torso and head, and both small pulse systems are in the center torso. All of these weapons are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer, making them more accurate at range. The valuable but aging TRSS 2L3 targeting system could not function properly with the targeting computer, however, requiring its replacement with a Federated Stalker system.

'''Mechs/OTL-5M'''

==Description==

The 5M variant of the Ostsol is an upgrade of the design using Star League technology and is built for close-range combat with production starting in 3050. The original engine, heat sinks, and weapons have been stripped from the chassis and replaced with a Hermes 300 XL engine and sixteen double heat sinks. Taking the place of its standard weapons, the 5M Ostsol carries two Tronel XIII Large Pulse Lasers and four Tronel XII Medium Pulse Lasers, two of which remain rear-mounted to discourage attacks against the 'Mech's weak rear armor. Finally, for added protection against missile attacks, the 5M carries a Lindblad Shotgun Anti-Missile System in its right torso with one ton of ammo in the left.

'''Mechs/OTL-5D'''

==Description==

A House Davion upgrade of the 4D model first fielded in 3065, the 5D upgrades its armor to eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and mounts five additional Rocket Launcher 10s, giving the Ostsol incredible one-shot firepower in a pinch and added shock value when facing an enemy. The fact it is very similar to the Taurian Concordat's OSR-3C Ostroc has raised questions as to the variant's origins.

'''Mechs/OTL-4F'''

==Description==

The 4F Ostsol introduced in 2871 was the only common variant of the 'Mech pre-Clan Invasion, completely removing the laser weapons and replacing them with two Dominion-V PPCs in the side torsos. The 'Mech is seen as, in some ways at least, a poor man's Marauder or Warhammer, and the PPC array can quickly overload the sixteen heat sinks. Though, on its own merits, the variant is a good long-range direct fire support 'Mech which uses its top speed of 86.4 kph to dictate combat ranges against most heavier 'Mechs.

The Ostsol OTL-4DR was an attempt by Ostmann Industries to create a version of the 'Mech that could be built faster and handled hot environments better. Replacing all weapons with a pair of ER PPCs, switching to Double Heat Sinks and adding a C3 Slave unit did not meet the goals and the variant was never built in any larger volumes.

'''Mechs/OTL-4D'''

==Description==

Nine tons of armoring is considered decent for a heavy 'Mech, while its fast cruising speed of 54 km/h is thanks to a nineteen-ton Vlar 300 fusion engine. Besides speed though it's the 'Mech's highly-sensitive TRSS.2L3 targeting-tracking system, able to detect enemies over several kilometers in even the most difficult terrain, which makes it a good command platform for scouting missions. Sixteen heat sinks also help manage the heat output of its all-energy weapons payload.

'''Mechs/OWR-3M'''

==Description==

The modern 3M version built at Ronin Incorporated's facility on Wallis in 3075, replaced all its components with advanced technology. Powered by a standard Hermes 260 Fusion engine, which increased the 'Mech's top speed by 10 kph, the chassis was protected by eleven tons of light ferro-fibrous armor and CASE mounted in both side torsos. Swapping the standard SRM racks for more advanced and ammo-efficient Shannon SH-47 Streak SRM-4 launchers and standard Medium Lasers for modern Diverse Optics ER Medium Lasers, with the LRM-20 launcher enhanced with Artemis IV FCS.

'''Mechs/OWR-2MX'''

==Description==

A refresh of the Ostwar OWR-2M, the OWR-2MX replaces the LRM and Medium Lasers with an upgrade to double SRM6 launchers and 3 Extended Range Large Lasers. Using an XL engine and Endo Steel structure allows the switch to Double Heat Sinks for better cooling performance as well as an upgrade to a 325 rated fusion core. One large oddity is the fact the SRM6 launchers are in the legs, leading a strange angle of launching that can surprise enemy Mech Warriors.

==Description==

An updated version of the primitive Ostwar developed in 2620, this variant carries 12 tons of standard BattleMech armor and a modern cockpit. The chassis has been upgraded to use Endo Steel, while an XL Engine increases the Ostwar's ground speed to 84 kmh. Eighteen double heat sinks dissipate the heat from three ER Large Lasers and twin SRM-6 launchers.

'''Mechs/PTR-4FX'''

==Description==

In an attempt to make the -4F more durable, the -4FX variant was a field modification of the Penetrator. Replacing the 4 Medium Pulse Lasers with 6 Medium Lasers allowed the addition of CASE in both side torsos, which after moving the Anti-Missile System ammunition from Center Torso to the Left Torso ensured any ammo explosion should not be able to penetrate the Center Torso. The 0.5 ton weight capacity still remaining was used to improve the armor of the legs and side torsos.

'''Mechs/PTR-4F'''

==Description==

Intended to act as a fire support 'Mech, The PTR-4F Penetrator sacrifices two of its Medium Pulse Lasers and the ER Large Lasers, freeing enough tonnage to add two LRM-10 missile launchers. The LRM-10s were then mated to Artemis IV fire control systems for added accuracy.

'''Mechs/PTR-4D'''

==Description==

The Penetrator PTR-4D has an all energy weapons arsenal and uses twelve double heat sinks to handle the massive heat load from its weapons. The 'Mech uses a Vlar 300 fusion engine for its combat durability, giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 kph. To help offset the 'Mech's lack of mobility, the Penetrator has four Anderson 398 jump jets giving it added mobility with a jumping distance of one hundred and twenty meters. The Penetrator also carries a respectable thirteen tons of armor. The 'Mech's heavy armor protection, combined with its standard engine and limited amounts of ammunition, make for a 'Mech that is very rugged and hard to kill. The primary weapons are a pair of arm mounted Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Lasers for long range firepower. For close range combat, the 'Mech carries six Sutel Precision Line Medium Pulse Lasers which are mounted in its right and left torsos. Finally, the 'Mech carries its only ammunition based weapon, a Yori Flyswatter Anti-Missile System, for added defense against missile attacks.

'''Mechs/P1W'''

==Description==

The Perseus is the product of a program begun by the League Central Coordination and Command to create an OmniMech completely indigenous to the Free Worlds League from concept to production. The Perseus shares much with the venerable Orion, a staple of Free Worlds League Military, both broadly resembling the older design visually and using a number of the same components. This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the Omni-Orion and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis. Built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis, the Perseus is powered by a Hermes 300 XL engine helping save even more weight and giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.

This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the Omni-Orion and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis. Built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis, the Perseus is powered by a Hermes 300 XL engine helping save even more weight and giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.

'''Mechs/QKD-5M'''

==Description==

Technicron's replacement for the original 4G model, the 5M was introduced in 3049 as an answer to the original's heat problems by replacing the thirteen normal heat sinks with double-strength versions. It also improved the design's defenses by swapping out the regular armor with Kallon FWL Special Ferro-Fibrous and installing CASE for the LRM's ammunition. The space necessary for these upgrades was provided for by removing the SRM launcher for a one-shot Hovertec SRM-4 Launcher, a disposable missile launcher more commonly found on VTOLs, hovercraft and similar combat vehicles. The loss in sheer short-range firepower is more than made up for by the other upgrades to the design.

==Description==

The 5K Quickdraw is an upgraded variant using Star League technology produced by Luthien Armor Works in 3049. Carrying the same weaponry as the 5A model, its use of seventeen double heat sinks solves the problem of excessive waste heat. It also uses Ferro-Fibrous armor, giving the 5K superior armor protection to the 5A model, with no added weight.

'''Mechs/MDG-1AR'''

==Description==

The Rakshasa was designed by engineers at the New Avalon Institute of Science in an attempt to copy the Mad Cat. The finished product, while not as powerful as the OmniMech it emulates, is a powerful 'Mech with an undeserved bad reputation. The Rakshasa is powered by a GM 375 XL engine and built on a GM Marauder Special MD Endo Steel chassis to save weight and allow the 'Mech to carry as similar a weapons payload as possible to the Mad Cat.

'''Mechs/RFL-LK'''

==Description==

Gray Noton's infamous 'Legend-Killer' used LosTech, outfitted with an 240-rated XL engine and built on an Endo Steel frame to free up the weight to swap the classic RFL-3N's AC/5s for LB-X Autocannon/10s fed with three tons of reloads. With the RFL-3N's Large and Medium Lasers retained, the remaining weight saved after the LB-X autocannons goes towards an extra half ton of armor while a swap to double heat sinks gives it unexpected endurance in the arenas.

==Description==

The Rifleman MUSE WIND was an Experimental Technology experiment to combine Clan and Inner Sphere equipment in a production Mech. An Inner Sphere produced chassis, XL Engine, XL Gyro, double heat sinks, and Jump Jets form the core of the 'Mech. The Ferro-Fibrous armor that maximizes protection comes from the Clans, as does the weaponry: Each arm mounts a HAG/20 anda single Clan Medium Pulse Laser.

'''Mechs/RFL-4D'''

==Description==

The 4D was one of two variants designed by Hanse Davion; it was intended to compete with the heavier Warhammer. It replaced the autocannon/5s with PPCs and removed the medium lasers, using the freed-up weight to mount an five extra heat sinks. In spite of the extra heat sinks, this model suffered from significant overheat problems.

==Description==

Simple, straightforward, and accurate; the Rifleman IIC is armed with four Large Pulse Lasers. This allows it to pick apart enemies from a respectable range, as well as easily target incoming aircraft. A single ER Small Laser is installed, seemingly as an afterthought. Nineteen double heat sinks keep heat mostly in check, though volley fire should be used.

'''Mechs/RFL-IIC-3'''

==Description==

Following the surprise invasion of Huntress, most of the Clans looked to upgrade the defenders of their homeworlds. In so doing, Clan Cloud Cobra decided to upgrade their aging Rifleman IICs. The IIC 3 first entered service in the early part of 3062. Based upon the original design, it nonetheless uses two Model HHC-30 Ultra Autocannon/2s to plink at a target from long range. Any opponent who believes he or she is facing a IIC 2 is quickly surprised, however, when the IIC 3 opens up with its paired Series 4D-2 Heavy Large Lasers. Twenty one double heat sinks keep this design cool-running. This rebuilt version still mounts the Active Probe.

'''Mechs/RFL-IIC-2'''

==Description==

This variant removes all of the weapons and equipment, and replaces them with four Ultra Autocannon/2s and six tons of ammunition. The weight saved, plus a half ton from armor, is used to upgrade the engine to allow the 'Mech a top speed of 64 km/h. MechWarriors must be exceptionally wary of the large, vulnerable ammo bins.

'''Mechs/RFL-IIC-1'''

==Description==

Simple, straightforward, and accurate; the Rifleman IIC is armed with four Large Pulse Lasers. This allows it to pick apart enemies from a respectable range, as well as easily target incoming aircraft. A single ER Small Laser is installed, seemingly as an afterthought. Nineteen double heat sinks keep heat mostly in check, though volley fire should be used.

'''Mechs/ST-ALN'''

==Description==

The Shootist first saw service in 2621 as a heavily armored, electronic warfare-capable command 'Mech for SLDF Royal BattleMech Regiments. However, the Shootist's upgraded electronic suites proved no match for the cutting edge of electronic warfare of its own time. When the BattleMaster eclipsed the Shootist in its intended role as a command vehicle merely ten years after its introduction, the SLDF changed the Shootist's mission parameters. The Shootist's balanced mix of weapons and speed, and its heavy armor allowed it a new role: juggernaut for close-combat heavy lances, and later, a bodyguard unit for command lances. This role never proved favorable to the longevity of the Shootist; since the Succession Wars, this BattleMech is rarely seen outside of the ComGuards, Word of Blake Militia, and ancient Clan Brian Caches.

'''Mechs/ST-9C'''

==Description==

The Shootist first saw service in 2621 as a heavily armored, electronic warfare-capable command 'Mech for SLDF Royal BattleMech Regiments. However, the Shootist's upgraded electronic suites proved no match for the cutting edge of electronic warfare of its own time. When the BattleMaster eclipsed the Shootist in its intended role as a command vehicle merely ten years after its introduction, the SLDF changed the Shootist's mission parameters. The Shootist's balanced mix of weapons and speed, and its heavy armor allowed it a new role: juggernaut for close-combat heavy lances, and later, a bodyguard unit for command lances. This role never proved favorable to the longevity of the Shootist; since the Succession Wars, this BattleMech is rarely seen outside of the ComGuards, Word of Blake Militia, and ancient Clan Brian Caches.

==Description==

Apparently based on the Timber Wolf, the Sidewinder OmniMech was developed by Clan Cloud Cobra in preparation for the Clan Invasion of the Inner Sphere. When it turned out that the Cloud Cobras would likely not be among the invader clans they became increasingly desperate and eventually fielded a Sidewinder against Clan Jade Falcon in a trial on Babylon that they lost. The Jade Falcons salvaged the heavily damaged 'Mech and all available information is based on their investigation of the design.

'''Mechs/SJN-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Sojourner is a simple 'Mech designed by Clan Wolf-in-Exile after the staggering loss at Arc-Royal. The 'Mech went through several design phases resulting in a final design that was both easy to maintain and pilot, with the primary use being to teach younger MechWarriors the trade of 'Mech-on-'Mech combat. As a result the pilots of these 'Mechs have a considerably higher survival rate compared to other, harder to pilot 'Mechs like the Linebacker. The base variant of the Sojourner carries a Gauss Rifle, with the compliment of a single ER Large Laser and a Plasma Cannon. The combination of 3 Jump Jets, a Supercharger and an AES system makes the 'Mech quite mobile on the battlefield despite its somewhat underpowered 240-rated Fusion Core. A CASE II system and a single external Double Heat Sink finishes up the design.

==Description==

The Sunspider E leans heavily on the flexibility of the iATM weapon system. Quad iATM6 and two tons of every ammo type ensure fire can be delivered to fit any range and situation. A pair of medium pulse lasers and a brace of four ER micro lasers augment close range firepower.

'''Mechs/SNS-D'''

==Description==

A short-ranged brawler, the Sun Spider D carries a mammoth Ultra AC/20 in each arm, with just a pair of Heavy Machine Guns in the right torso as supporting weapons. Lacking in ranged weapons, an ECM Suite is fitted in the left torso to try and assist in closing with its foes so it can make full use of the four tons of Ultra ammunition and single ton HMG bin.

'''Mechs/TNS-4S'''

==Description==

Intended to emulate the Thor OmniMech used by the Clans, the Thanatos is an incredibly sturdy and hard-hitting design. Copying both the looks and the capabilities of the Clan Thor, the Thanatos is a fast all-range design, though it skimps on armor a bit for a mech its size. Carrying an ER Large Laser for long range and a brace of advanced medium lasers and a MRM-20 for medium to close range, the Thanatos has a weapon for any situation. Combined with a fast 86.4 km/h top speed and five jump jets, the Thanatos can often catch what it cannot out-range.

'''Mechs/TDR-8S'''

==Description==

The Thunderbolt-8S is an attempt to streamline and simplify the Thunderbolt's typically eclectic loadout. It drops every weapon off the mech and replaces them all with a pair of ER PPCs with a PPC Capacitor charging them further. An Angel ECM suite keeps the mech protected while 4 jump jets keep it mobile in any terrain. 16 double heat sinks try their best to keep the mech cool but generally speaking aren't enough for aggressive pilots.

'''Mechs/TDR-7M'''

==Description==

Designed with Star League technology, the 7M has been re-armored using Ferro-Fibrous armor, allowing the 'Mech's weapons to be upgraded with the freed weight. With an arsenal based on the 5S model, the 7M carries an LRM-15 missile launcher in the right torso, an ER Large Laser in the right arm, three medium lasers and a Streak SRM-2 launcher in the left torso, and a pair of machine guns in the left arm. Two tons of LRM reloads are kept in the right torso while one ton each of Streak and machine gun ammo are kept in the left torso. Additionally, the heat sinks have been upgraded to double heat sinks and CASE has been added to protect against ammunition explosion.

'''Mechs/TDR-5LS'''

==Description==

Developed in 2850 as the Second Succession War saw more and more technologies disappear, the 5LS was a downgraded field refit and a factory model of the now impossible to build 5L. While the ER Large Laser and Starfish Small Pulse Lasers were retained, the standard LRM-15 and Bical SRM-2 rack were noticeably less accurate than the 5L's more advanced launchers, but nothing compared to the replacement of the 5L's double heat sinks with fifteen standard models and the heat management issues that resulted. Production of even the "primitive" 5LS would end during the Third Succession War.

'''Mechs/TDR-5L'''

==Description==

The so-called "Lost Thunderbolt", the 5L was a downgraded version of the Royal 5Sb Thunderbolt developed by Earthwerks Tikonov in 2823. Built on a more basic standard chassis, the now LosTech ER PPC was swapped for a Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Laser but most of the 5Sb's systems were preserved with only the loss of one double heat sink and the head-mounted Small Laser. Production of the design only lasted a mere twenty-seven years before further technology decline resulted in the 5LS.

'''Mechs/TDR-IIC-2'''

==Description==

Introduced in 3088, this advanced variant of the Thunderbolt IIC is built with durability in mind. The design came into existence due to Jade Falcons need to re-purpose surplus components being produced for their Loki and Thor OmniMech designs. Using one of Olivetti Weaponry's previous Inner Sphere designs, the classic Thunderbolt, they reworked it as a replacement for second-line 'Mechs lost during the Jihad.

The Thunderbolt IIC is a second-line heavy BattleMech that was originally developed for Clan Jade Falcon in 3085.

'''Mechs/TW-PRYDE'''

==Description==

A non-standard alternate configuration of the Timber Wolf, this configuration was famously used by Star Colonel Aidan Pryde. The primary long range weapons are a pair of ER Large Lasers which are backed up by a pair of LRM-20s for long range combat. For close combat, two ER Medium Lasers are carried as well as an ER Small Laser. The Pryde Configuration also mounts four jump jets making it highly maneuverable.

==Description==

The Timber Wolf is a fast, heavy OmniMech. A signature design of the Clans' military might, it was arguably the first Clan OmniMech encountered by Inner Sphere forces on The Rock by Phelan Kell. Vaguely resembling a cross-over between the MAD (Marauder) and CAT (Catapult) series, the Timber Wolf was tagged with the Inner Sphere reporting name Mad Cat on first contact.

'''Mechs/TYM-1C'''

==Description==

Built due to an awkward exchange of technology between the Free Worlds League and the Word of Blake, the Toyama was designed by Dr. Thaddeus Anable and then given to the Word of Blake through an agreement made by Captain-General Thomas Marik. The Toyama is intended to be a multi-role BattleMech that can operate somewhat independently of supply lines. The 'Mech is built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis which supports a Vlar 300 XL engine. The Toyama has a top speed of 64.8 km/h, making it capable of keeping pace with most heavy 'Mechs. The Toyama has an impressive twelve tons of Durallex Heavy armor. To dissipate heat, the Toyama carries fourteen double heat sinks. The 'Mech also carries a Garret/Guardian Interface Guardian ECM Suite to protect the 'Mech from advanced enemy electronic warfare systems.

The 'Mech is built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis which supports a Vlar 300 XL engine. The Toyama has a top speed of 64.8 km/h, making it capable of keeping pace with most heavy 'Mechs. The Toyama has an impressive twelve tons of Durallex Heavy armor. To dissipate heat, the Toyama carries fourteen double heat sinks. The 'Mech also carries a Garret/Guardian Interface Guardian ECM Suite to protect the 'Mech from advanced enemy electronic warfare systems.

==Description==

Despite the dark cloud of graft looming over the Valkyrie II project, the Steiner and Davion stables of Solaris VII quickly jumped at the opportunity to get their hands on the heavily armored and incredibly fast Valkyrie II chassis for retrofitting into gladiatorial designs. 'Sigrun' is one such design fitted with a Plasma Cannon and BattleMech Sword; these weapons in combination with it's speed, armor, and advanced electronics makes it a nightmare in many Solaris arenas.

'''Mechs/VLK-II-2A'''

==Description==

The Valkyrie II project originated as an assignment for two NAIS student design teams to create a new heavy scout and skirmisher mech based on the Valkyrie VLK-QA. A rivalry between the two teams and outside pressures from Davion bureaucrats pushed both designs far beyond a replacement for the VLK-QA. Corean Enterprises was contracted to construct the Valkyrie II-2A which sports a 300 rating Light Fusion Engine, five Jump Jets, an ER Large Laser, a quartet of ER Medium Lasers, and nearly thirteen tons of armor.

'''Mechs/WHM-7S'''

==Description==

The 7S Warhammer was the official upgraded version built for the Federated Commonwealth by Olivettie Weaponry. Built out of their Sudeten factory starting in 3050, the 7S retained the small lasers of the original but updated the rest of the weaponry. It carried two arm-mounted ER PPCs, two Defiance P5M medium pulse lasers in the side torsos, and two Coventry T4H Streak SRM-2 launchers in place of the SRM-6 launcher. Eighteen double heat sinks handled the additional waste heat and one ton of reloads for the Streak launchers was carried in the center torso.

'''Mechs/WHM-7M'''

==Description==

The 7M variant was introduced in 3047 by Ronin Inc. as the official upgraded variant of the Warhammer for the Free Worlds League. Built around a Magna 280 fusion engine, the 7M had a top speed of 64.5 km/h and carried eighteen double heat sinks to handle the waste heat generated by its two Fusigon Longtooth ER PPCs. Backing up these new weapons were two Martell medium lasers in the side torsos and a Shannon SH-60 SRM-6 launcher over the right shoulder. A LFN Lindblad machine gun was carried in the right torso, while the left mounted an LFN Lindblad Shotgun Anti-Missile System. One ton of machine gun rounds were carried in the center torso, while one ton each of missile reloads and AMS rounds were carried in the right.

'''Mechs/WHM-6RB'''

==Description==

The Warhammer-6Rb is a variant made for the Star League's Royal regiments. Highly similar to the Warhammer-6R, the -6Rb's differences lie in the armor and heat dissipation systems that have been upgraded to the Star League standard with Ferro-Fibrous and double heat sinks respectively.

'''Mechs/WHM-6R'''

==Description==

The Warhammer BattleMech was introduced by StarCorps Industries in 2515 to be "a mobile 'Mech with enough firepower to destroy or severely damage any 'Mech of the same weight class or lower." In the mission it was designed for, the Warhammer proved to be a very capable 'Mech, and for centuries practically defined the entire class of heavy 'Mechs. Boasting incredible firepower and respectable armoring, the Warhammer served prominently in the Star League Defense Force and was one of the premier 'Mechs in the Gunslinger Program. Indeed, many of the greatest MechWarriors in history were Warhammer pilots.

==Description==

The 6L was a very basic weapons swap of the 6R model used by Capellan armed forces. Known as the "Hot Hammer" and debuting in 2825, the two machine guns and their ammunition were removed in order to mount two Flamers added for anti-infantry use.

==Description==

Another basic modification to the Warhammer, the 6K was favored by the Draconis Combine after its introduction in 2830. The 6K removed the machine guns and their volatile ammunition to make room for two heat sinks, allowing it to more easily dissipate waste heat from its PPCs.

'''Mechs/YMN-10-OR'''

==Description==

A Jihad-era update of the Yeoman, the 10-OR incorporates newer equipment into the design. The LRM-15s have been removed in favor of four MML-5 Launchers which have been given 3 tons of ammunition. These new launchers give the 'Mech a better means of protecting itself at short ranges. The 'Mech has been given Jump Jets and an XL Gyro. The weight saved with these changes allows for additional armor to be installed on the arms and legs.

'''Mechs/ALB-5W'''

==Description==

The Albatross was designed by the Free Worlds League in 3053 with an eye toward a possible future conflict with the then advancing Clans. The 'Mech is built using a Hermes 380 XL Engine to minimize weight and maximize free tonnage for its weapon loadout. The Albatross also uses a variety of weapons in an attempt to make the 'Mech effective at any range. The 'Mech has average mobility with a maximum speed of 64.8 kph and also makes use of double heat sinks for their greater heat dissipation capability.

'''Mechs/ANH-SG'''

==Description==

The very definition of a FrankenMech, the Schwerer Gustav is a hybrid combination of six different designs, primarily the Annihilator, Verfolger and Berserker. Underneath its strange exterior, a hybrid standard and Endo Steel chassis serves as a sturdy frame for the advanced and standard equipment it carries. A 400 rated XL Engine swaddled in fifteen double heat sinks gives the 'Mech surprising speed and staying power for its size, while a Compact Gyro frees space for a Bloodhound Active Probe in the center torso. Intended for service in the Tooth of Ymir's command lance, the Schwerer Gustav also includes a Command Console in the head to allow a tactical officer to enter direct combat. Armed with a Thumper Artillery Piece for ranged combat and a BInary Laser  paired with a Clan made RAC/5 for close combat, the Schwerer Gustav is equally adep at shredding targets at range or in close.

==Description==

Originally developed in the final year of the Amaris Civil War as the ultimate fixed position city defense BattleMech, the Annihilator was built as a sign of the military strength of the Star League in Exile. The -1A was armed with four Autocannon/10s and four Medium Lasers. While less accurate than the original -2A, the 1A was still a highly destructive and dangerous 'Mech that no MechWarrior looked forward to engaging.

==Description==

More closely in line with the traditional Annihilator, the 4A carried two LB-X Autocannon/10s from the 2A, but removed two to make room for a pair of Heavy PPCs. Two Light Autocannon/2s from the 3A provide defense against conventional troops. A Compact Gyro freed up enough room for fifteen double heat sinks that kept heat from being completely out of control.

'''Mechs/ANH-3A'''

==Description==

This upgrade made use of double heat sinks and used the tonnage saved to max out the armor on the Annihilator. Offensively, four ER Medium Lasers and eight Light Autocannon/2s were incredibly accurate thanks to the inclusion of a Targeting Computer. Ample autocannon ammunition (five tons) allowed flexibility when choosing special munitions, making this 'Mech very effective against vehicles. To fit all this equipment, a Compact Engine and Compact Gyro are mounted in the center torso. The 'Mech is protected by Light Ferro Fibrous armor and CASE.

'''Mechs/ANH-2AX'''

==Description==

Developed by the Arc-Royal MechWorks, the Annihilator-2AX used nineteen tons of Laser Reflective Armor as protection. It also used several Armored Components to increase battlefield longevity (Sensors, Life Support, and Cockpit). The traditional weapons have been removed and replaced by a pair of Improved Heavy Gauss Rifles. CASE was installed in each torso to protect against Gauss rifle explosion. The ammunition for the Gauss rifles was located in the Annihilator's arms.

'''Mechs/ANH-1E'''

==Description==

Still a fearsome and powerful design, where the original Annihilator-1A carries a bevy of powerful autocannons, the -1E instead opts for an all-energy weapon loadout. Four Particle Projection Cannons give the Annihilator-1E a brutal and incredibly powerful punch while the Medium Lasers from the -1A are carried over for in-close protection while increasing the armor protection somewhat to mitigate enemy return fire.

'''Mechs/ANH-1A'''

==Description==

Originally developed in the final year of the Amaris Civil War as the ultimate fixed position city defense BattleMech, the Annihilator was built as a sign of the military strength of the Star League in Exile. The -1A was armed with four Autocannon/10s and four Medium Lasers. While less accurate than the original -2A, the 1A was still a highly destructive and dangerous 'Mech that no MechWarrior looked forward to engaging.

==Description==

Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops. The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an anchor for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a zombie because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

==Description==

This experimental variant of the Archangel was based on salvaged schematics by Blake agents from the clans, building on experimental technology for both the clans and the inner sphere to produce a tactically superior weapons platform. The cost however to build this monstrosity limited it to just the prototype reaching full combat readiness.

'''Mechs/C-ANG-OC'''

==Description==

Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops. The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an anchor for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a zombie because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.

'''Mechs/AS7-BH'''

==Description==

The AS7 'Boar's Head' is a little-seen trial Atlas run that attempted to make a more mobile striker assault 'Mech while still maintaining the dreaded reputation of the Atlas. Among Defiance's changes included routing all the energy weapon power couplings to the arms - 3 in each - and a massive XL engine. Ultimately, the AS7-BH proved too fragile and vulnerable to weapons loss for it's weight and altogether excessive cost.

'''Mechs/AS7-S3'''

==Description==

The S3 Atlas is a rearmament of the S2 version introduced in 3062. The Heavy Gauss Rifle is reduced to a standard model Gauss Rifle with sixteen shots while each arm contains a PPC and a Small Laser. An additional small laser is mounted in the head. For extra defense, an AMS is installed on the left arm. The Artemis IV-enhanced LRM-15 and Guardian ECM Suite of the S2 model remain.

'''Mechs/AS7-S2'''

==Description==

The S2 Atlas was a major upgrade of the design by the Lyran Alliance coming out of the Hesperus II facility in 3061. The 'Mech was built with a Light Fusion Engine and carried an Artemis IV Fire Control System enhanced LRM-15 launcher and two ER large lasers as its primary long range weapons. For close combat, the 'Mech was armed with a Heavy Gauss Rifle. The S2 mounted a Guardian ECM Suite in place of the AMS to protect against enemy electronic warfare equipment.

'''Mechs/AS7-S'''

==Description==

A very basic FedCom upgrade of the standard Atlas introduced in 3050, the S model removed five heat sinks from the design, upgrading the rest to Double Heat Sinks. The weight savings are used to add two rear firing Coventry T4H Streak SRM-2 launchers, giving the Atlas increased protection in its rear arc of fire. After the civil war production of this model ceased, although garrison forces in both sundered states continued to use them, with AFFS units using Precision Ammunition for the autocannon and LAAF units making use of specialized LRM munitions captured from the Free Worlds League.

'''Mechs/AS7-K'''

==Description==

A Combine upgrade of the Atlas that used rediscovered Star League technology, the K model was built with a Vlar 300 XL Engine. Carrying a Shigunga LRM-20 with two tons of ammo in the left torso the 'Mech was rearmed for long range combat with an Imperator Dragon's Fire Gauss Rifle in place of the autocannon, with two tons of gauss rounds carried in the right arm, backed up by a pair of Victory Nickel Alloy ER Large Lasers split between both arms. This armament allowed the AS7-K to keep an enemy at range, though the continued use of twenty single heat sinks caused swift heat buildup if both lasers are fired repeatedly. For close range defense, the K model carried two Victory Heartbeat Medium Pulse Lasers and a Yori Flyswatter Anti-Missile System in the left arm. To round off the AS7-K's defense, CASE was added to the side torsos to protect against an ammunition explosion.

==Description==

A Clan-tech retrofit of the AS7-D Atlas, the Atlas C replaced the older autocannon and missile launchers with a Clan standard Ultra AC/20, Swarm LRM compatible LRM-20, and Streak SRM-6 launchers; but the Inner Sphere Medium Lasers remained unchanged. Lighter Clan components allowed the Atlas C to carry 3 tons of autocannon ammunition.

'''Mechs/AS7-C'''

==Description==

A Combine modification of the K model introduced in 3050, the C model carried a C3 Slave unit into combat. This was achieved by removing one of the Medium Pulse Lasers from the K model. The extra free ton was used to add another heat sink to the design.

==Description==

The Atlas A is the first try to be the king of the battlefield, capable of bringing a dizzying array of weapons to bear on targets at any range. It is also noteworthy for normally mounting the maximum amount of armor possible. Few opponents can survive even brief contact with this monster.

==Description==

The Atlas 'AS5-HAT'. Pretty typical of pirates to rewire the IFF to be this subtle. It's a pretty standard Atlas chassis, but some genius rewrote the articulation program for the hands to flip the bird when firing.

'''Mechs/AS7-D-H'''

==Description==

First fielded in 2765, the Atlas II was designed by the Hegemony Research and Development Department, Weapons Division of the original Star League to maintain the technological edge over the other Great Houses. It was exclusively for the SLDF's Royal Regiments. In 2785, when General Aleksandr Kerensky put out his call for loyal forces to join him in his Exodus, every Atlas II pilot responded and left with him. The Atlas II is armed with an array of weaponry, including an LB-X Autocannon/10, a pair of ER Large Lasers, and a 20-tube Long Range Missile Launcher for long range attacks. For close range combat, the 'Mech is equipped with a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers and a Holly Six Pack. In addition, the 'Mech has been given CASEfor both sides of the torso in order to keep an ammunition cook-off from consuming the 'Mech.

'''Mechs/AS7-D2'''

==Description==

 The D2 variant is intended for front line use instead of the rare D3's command role. This model retains the D3's Streak LRM-20, Streak SRM-6, and two of the Medium X-Pulse Lasers found in the left arm. The D2 drops the Rotary Autocannon for a more powerful Clan Class 30 Hyper-Assault Gauss Rifle.

'''Mechs/AWS-9Q'''

==Description==

A basic upgrade to the original 8Q introduced in 3057, the heat sinks are upgraded to double heat sinks and are reduced to nineteen. The saved weight is used to add a fourth PPC to the 'Mech as well as a Guardian ECM Suite. Although there was some criticism for using basic PPCs and not upgrading to ER models, the 9Q proved itself during Operation Guerrero to be quite devastating.

==Description==

The 9M is an upgrade of the Awesome that uses Star League technologies. The 'Mech is built around a 320 Hermes XL Fusion engine, giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The heat sinks were upgraded to double heat sinks to allow this variant to be rearmed with three Fusigon Longtooth ER PPCs. The ER PPCs are backed up by two Hovertec Streak SRM-2s, split between the left arm and center torso and fed by one ton of reloads in the left leg, a Magna 400P Medium Pulse Laser also in the center torso, and a Diverse Optics Type 10 Small Pulse Laser in place of the head-mounted small laser.

'''Mechs/AWS-10KM'''

==Description==

The newest variant, a joint project between IBMU and Alshain Weaponry, was introduced in 3067. The 'Mech utilizes Irian's Compact Engine and Compact Gyro to save space at the expense of mass. It retains the speed and ECM of the 9Q, but utilizes an Endo Steel structure. Two Heavy PPCs deal a good amount of damage in each blow, while a Snub-Nose PPC is deadly and accurate at close range. At the time of its introduction the 10KM was reserved for only the elite units of the Free Worlds League and Draconis Combine, and thanks to an iron-clad contract even the wily Irian Technologies had trouble finding a loophole to sell the 'Mech to the other Houses or mercenary units.

'''Mechs/B-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it, the Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units.

'''Mechs/B-4'''

==Description==

The Bane 4 is designed to address the ammunition-dependency of the earlier Banes. In this upgrade, Clan Jade Falcon scientists changed many elements of the Bane slightly, resulting in a 'Mech with a different appearance than its predecessors. Its focus is also short range, as evidenced by twin Ultra Autocannon/20s. Six tons of ammunition is adequate, though only barely. Three ATM 6s, along with four tons of ammunition, give the design great flexibility at all ranges. A single ER Large Laser allows the 'Mech to stay in the fight in the event its ammunition bins have run dry. Seventeen double heat sinks are unequal to the task assigned them.

'''Mechs/B-3'''

==Description==

Designed for fire support, the Bane 3 is a radical rework of the Bane. Eight LRM-15 provide the bulk of the designs fire, with sixteen tons of ammunition supplying the launchers. A Streak SRM-4 provides limited close support. Nineteen double heat sinks are up to the task of keeping the design cool.

'''Mechs/BNC-5S-VDG'''

==Description==

A custom BNC-5S piloted by Solaris VII duelist Victor Vandergriff during the Solaris riots of 3062. The weapon loadout in this variant is similar to a standard BNC-5S. Two ER PPCs are the main armaments, one mounted in the left arm and the other in the right torso. A LB-10X sits in the left torso. The two medium lasers of the original are retained in the left arm. The right arm contains a small SRM-4. Finally, four Luxor jump jets are added for increased mobility.

'''Mechs/BNC-5S-JB'''

==Description==

After surviving the Jihad, then Hauptmann John Baur was promoted to Kommandant and reassigned to the Fifth Lyran Guard, taking his Banshee with him. The much-maligned 'Mech has been retrofitted to match the configuration of Bauer's personal hero, a Solaris VII dueliust named VictorVandergriff, weho died before the onset of the FedCom civil war.

'''Mechs/BNC-PM'''

==Description==

An almost total refitting of a Banshee by a crazed ex-gladiator from Solaris VII resulted in the monostrosity known as the "Pyromaniac". The combination of a heat specific FCS and the armament of 4 Plasma Cannons, two Heavy Flamers, two Inferno-firing SRM-6 launchers and a head mounted flamer, all very heavily modified, shows why the 'Mech was given its name. Boosting a 375 ton XXL fusion engine makes the "Pyromaniac" more mobile than expected as well, combined with heavy armor making it a fearsome sight to spot on the battlefield. The downside of all this equipment is that both the center torso and the head has been utilized to fit the required ammo and no C.A.S.E system is installed. But this is just yet another sign how crazy the 'Mechs creator was.

'''Mechs/BNC-9S'''

==Description==

This upgrade of the 8S was produced by Defiance Industries at their Kwangjong-ni annex while Word of Blake held Hesperus II. It retains the light engine of earlier models, but returns to the speed of the earliest versions. It carries a Defiance 753 Heavy PPC, Defiance 250 Light PPC, and Poland Main Model A Gauss Rifle for long range combat. Should an enemy survive long enough to close with the 9S, it can utilize three Defiance E3M ER Medium Lasers and a single Defiance B3M Medium Laser. A TharHes Maxi SRM-6 can exploit weaknesses in an opposing unit's armor, while CASE keeps the ammunition from doing too much damage in the event of an explosion. In order to make room for all of these things, the XL Gyro of the 8S is also retained. Finally, a Targeting Computer improves the accuracy of all the weapons except for the missile launcher.

'''Mechs/BNC-8S'''

==Description==

The variant of the Banshee was created by the Word of Blake after they took over Hesperus II in 3070. It turns the 'Mech into a brawler with the inclusion of Triple Strength Myomer and a Hatchet. It returns to the XL Engine of the 5S and keeps the ubiquitous Small Laser. The LB-X Autocannon/10 is retained from the 6S, though it moves to the other side. An ER Large Laser is added for use at long range and a Snub-Nose PPC is effective at medium range, though it is more damaging up close. An XL Gyro frees up tonnage for four medium lasers, two standard and two extended range models, as well an ER Small Laser. The inclusion of only thirteen double heat sinks ensures that the myomer activates easily. A C3 Slave Unit allows the 8S to share targeting telemetry, though the fact that it is not one of the Word's improved versions suggests that this 'Mech is not intended for use by Word of Blake Militia, but rather their mercenaries or even important planetary garrisons. Finally, eighteen tons of armor and a Guardian ECM Suite radically improve the defenses of the venerable Banshee.

The 3M was a basic upgrade of the BattleMaster utilizing Star League technology. Introduced by Earthwerks Incorporated for the Free Worlds League in 3049, the 'Mech replaces the standard heat sinks with double heat sinks, upgrades its primary weapon to a Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC and removes one of the machine guns to add CASE to the design to protect itself in the event of an ammunition explosion.

==Description==

This Star League era variant removes two of the forward-facing medium lasers, both machine guns, the SRM launcher and their ammunition. In place of the SRM launcher are three Streak SRM-2 launchers with a single ton of ammunition with an extra PPC mounted in the left arm. Sixteen double heat sinks keep the 'Mech cool, and the 'Mech's armor is upgraded to Ferro-Fibrous armor. An extra half ton of armor is also installed.

'''Mechs/BRZ-A3'''

==Description==

The Berserker was designed as a massive close range brawling 'Mech. Because it is designed to engage an enemy at close range, the 'Mech needs to be able to close with its target to bring its incredibly destructive power to bear on an enemy. To do this, the Berserker is propelled to a top speed of 86.4 kph by using a Pitban 400 XL Engine and a MASC system.

==Description==

The 'Creep' - named for the ability to deliver a creeping barrage from stealth, built as a pet project by someone at RISC with too much money and a hate-boner for the Clan. A Blood Asp that had a pile of advanced tech bolted to it and was turned inside-out in the image of the Inner Sphere. This thing retains the Asp's frontline assault role, with more trickery. Keep the front toward the enemy and tape down that trigger block.

==Description==

The Bruin is a Rasalhague Dominion Assault Class BattleMech produced at the Dominion's Bergan Industries factory on Alshain. The Bruin's long-range firepower includes a right arm mounted Gauss Rifle and a center torso mounted LRM 10 Launcher. These two weapons give the 'Mech far reaching power, providing it the ability to penetrate an opponent's armor and damage its interior equipment. For its intermediate and short range brackets, the 'Mech is armed with a Large Pulse Laser in its left arm and an ER Medium Laser in each arm, along with a Streak SRM 4 Launchers in each torso. To manage heat, it has been provided with 14 Clan tech Double Heat Sinks. Its hull is protected by 15 tons of standard Clan armor with integrated CASE.

'''Mechs/CGR-N7'''

==Description==

Terry Ford's "Number Seven" is built around an 320-rated standard engine, the slower engine allows it to retain the 'Mech's ten tons of armor and head mounted small laser while freeing up weight to carry a Large Laser in each side torso supported by a Medium Laser in each arm and the right torso. Twenty-five single heat sinks and four jump jets ensure Number Seven surprising mobility and endurance in battle.

'''Mechs/CGR-SB'''

==Description==

This radical modification looks to turn the Charger into a traditional assault 'Mech by reducing the 'Mechs speed to 54 km/h, which allows the use of a smaller engine (incidentally, the commonplace Pitban 240 reactor). The 'Mech is armored with fifteen and a half tons of armor and is armed with four Large Lasers, one in each arm and side torso, and a Medium Laser in its head; twenty-eight heat sinks kept the 'Mech cool.

'''Mechs/CGR-SA5'''

==Description==

A variant of the Charger that took the 1A5 variant to its logical conclusion with new technologies, the SA5 was powered by a 320 rated Light Fusion Engine, giving it a speed of 64.8 km/h, while a MASC system was added allowing the 'Mech to reach speeds of 86.4 km/h in short bursts. The 'Mech was also built on an Endo Steel chassis to save even more weight. The SA5 carried an LB-X Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon. This was backed up by three ER Medium Lasers and two Streak SRM-6 launchers. The 'Mech was protected by fifteen and a half tons of armor.

'''Mechs/CGR-KMZ'''

==Description==

The "Kamikaze" variant is produced at a Luthien Armor Works plant on Shimonita that was purchased by the Sapphire Sunset yakuza clan and renamed Sapphire Metals. It has a top speed of 64 km/h, but utilizes improved jump jets that allow it to leap up to 180 meters. It also utilizes Light Ferro-Fibrous armor. It primarily has a long-range armament composed of two Light PPCs and a Heavy PPC. An MML 9 has two tons of ammunition, allowing it to be effective at both short and long range. Should an enemy manage to close, the "Kamikaze" carries a Sword in the shape of a wakizashi.

'''Mechs/CGR-C'''

==Description==

An upgrade of the 3K, the Charger C was modified to carry a C3 Slave unit that allowed it to share targeting data with other 'Mechs in its unit. In order to add the slave unit, a medium pulse laser had to be removed from the design. The left over mass went towards extra ammunition for the LRM launcher.

'''Mechs/CGR-3K'''

==Description==

Draconis Combine's 3K was an upgrade of the 1A9 that used an uprated XL engine to raise the Charger's top speed back to 86.4 km/h. The head-mounted small laser was removed, the medium lasers were swapped out for Medium Pulse Lasers, and the LRM-20 launcher was mated with an Artemis IV fire control system to improve accuracy. The addition of a fifth jump jet mounted in the rear torso gave the 'Mech a jumping distance of up to one hundred and fifty meters. This variant was confirmed to have been deployed on An Ting in the War of 3039 and may have been what Davion forces initially dubbed the Charger II; however, descriptions of the Charger II suggest that it was more likely a LRM-equipped variant of the Hatamoto-Chi (presumably the -Kaze).

'''Mechs/CGR-2A2'''

==Description==

A Periphery modification of the Charger, the 2A2 had one ton of armor removed and its weapons stripped out. In their place, the 2A2 carried a medium laser and five Rocket Launcher 10s. This modification gave the Charger an immense amount of firepower that could be used in one shot or over the course of a battle. With the Charger's role as a heavy scout, the one-shot nature of the Rocket Launchers was not considered much of a hindrance as if they had been placed on a dedicated assault 'Mech.

'''Mechs/CGR-1L'''

==Description==

An export model sold to the Capellan Confederation as part of the Kapteyn Accords, the CGR-1L was a simple modification of the Charger in an attempt to make it more effective following their disastrous use on Chara in 3023. In place of four and a half tons of armor and all five Small Lasers, the 1L mounts a Large Laser in its right arm and two medium lasers in either side torso. While more prone to overheating and less protected - mounting armor comparable to that of a traditional scout 'Mech - it was better capable of defending itself against other scout 'Mechs, and at the time that was good enough for the desperate warriors of the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces. Since then, the CGR-1L has remained in Capellan service as a training 'Mech and, according to rumor, punishment assignment for dissident soldiers.

'''Mechs/CGR-1A9'''

==Description==

A Combine-LAW attempt to make the Charger more effective at long ranges, the 1A9 used a reduced 320-rated engine, lowering its top speed to 64.8 km/h, and its arsenal was overhauled. All of the smaller lasers (except for the head mounted one) were replaced with medium lasers and a single LRM-20 launcher was mounted in the right torso, with two tons of reloads carried in the left torso. To make up for the lost mobility, four jump jets were also installed, two in each leg, to allow the Charger to jump up to one hundred and twenty meters. This variant was fielded in time to surprise the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039, but in years since the design fell into the hands of the Outworlds Alliance thanks to a legal snafu which gave Ravenna Electronics a production license.

'''Mechs/CGR-1A5'''

==Description==

The 1A5 variant of the Charger was one of the first variants of the Charger made to take it from the role of scout to assault 'Mech. A Capellan modification to the CGR-1Ls they received as part of the Kapteyn Accords, the engine was downgraded to a 320 version, which reduced the maximum speed of the 'Mech to 64.8 km/h, and four of the small lasers were removed. In their place was a Tomodzuru Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon, two Bical SRM-6 launchers and an Argra 3L Medium Laser, while the 'Mech's armor was increased by five tons. This made the CGR-1A5 extremely dangerous at close ranges and gave it a speed comparable to most 'Mechs in the heavy weight class, while carrying armor on par with other eighty-ton 'Mechs.

'''Mechs/CGR-1A1'''

==Description==

The Charger is seen as an example of abject failure in BattleMech design. Wells Technologies originally wanted to produce an ultra-heavy scout 'Mech for the Star League Defense Force that was not only fast but could survive contact with the enemy. This was done by building the Charger on an 80-ton frame, making it the heaviest scout 'Mech in existence, and powering it with a massive LTV 400 fusion engine that took up almost sixty percent of the Charger's mass. With a top speed which allowed it to outrun most other 'Mechs the Charger was then given ten tons of Durallex Heavy armor, enough to survive repeated hits from a Class 20 Autocannon. However these features left very little room for offensive capability, an intentional deficiency on the part of the design team as they saw any task other than gathering data a distraction.

'''Mechs/COR-8R3'''

==Description==

While Corsair is supposedly a generic Periphery term referring to heavy and assault class FrankenMechs cobbled together out of desperation as the Succession War era dragged on, with no specific weight or base chassis, the most successful of these are ninety-five ton brutes modeled in a generally similar style, usually marked with a COR designation.

'''Mechs/COR-RA'''

==Description==

Jake Kalmar's infamous Ravager was built around a 285-rated XL Engine to save weight to carry eighteen tons of armor and fifteen double heat sinks. Offensively the Ravager is armed with a Gauss Rifle in the left arm and a Ultra AC5 in the right torso, supported by a center torso mounted Large Pulse Laser, a standard Large Laser in the left torso and right arm, rounded out by a Medium Laser in the head and each arm. Two tons each of Gauss and UAC reloads gave it good endurance. The 'Mech was salvaged by Chloe's Cavaliers after they tracked Kalmar to Sigurd in 3037 and killed him there.

'''Mechs/CP-12-K'''

==Description==

The 12-K variant of the Cyclops takes the 'Mech to the logical conclusion based on equipment available to the DCMS. Built by Grumium and introduced in 3059, the 'Mech is armed with an Ultra Autocannon/10 for close to intermediate range combat. In place of the LRM launcher it carries an MRM-20 launcher, which compliments the Autocannon's range profile, while retaining two ER medium lasers and a Streak SRM-4 for for close ranges. The 'Mech is also armored with fourteen and a half tons of armor.

==Description==

Cyclops' use their imposing presence and unique communications equipment to control the battlefield. This Variant Seems to have been fielded by someone who got ambushed one too many times, carrying basically all kinds of scanners and replacing the Tacticon with a Command Console.

'''Mechs/CP-11-H'''

==Description==

An upgrade of the Cyclops that has come out of the Periphery, the 11-H was first sighted in 3064 among the ranks of Lady Death's pirates. The H is built on the standard 10-Z chassis but now carries eleven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and its weapons payload is heavily modified, carrying the standard Autocannon/20 and two medium lasers but replacing the rest for six Rocket Launcher 20s. This gives the 11-H the firepower to decimate anything that dares to close with it to attempt to make a kill.

'''Mechs/CP-11-G'''

==Description==

A full redesign of the Cyclops, the 11-G was built by Grumium Creations for the Second Star League Defense Force, Com Guards and Free Rasalhague Republic. Debuting in 3058 it redesigns the chassis to use Endo Steel construction and also replaces the standard armor with fifteen tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. For long range combat it retains the Gauss Rifle and LRM-10 missile launcher minus one ton of missile reloads, while the arm-mounted medium lasers and center-torso SRM launcher were also upgraded to ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-4 launcher. All ammunition for the weapons was also shifted to the right-side torso and uses CASE to protect itself from complete destruction in the event of an ammunition explosion.

'''Mechs/CP-11-C'''

==Description==

The 11-C is similar to the 11-A in that they carry an almost identical weapons payload. Built in 3050 the only difference is that the 11-C has removed the LRM-10 launcher and replaced it with a C3 Computer, which allows it to share targeting data and coordinate C3 lances. An additional two tons of armor have been added to the design as well. This makes the 11-C a highly effective sniper and command 'Mech.

==Description==

A common modification of the Cyclops that uses some rediscovered Star League technology, the 11-A was introduced in 3045 and replaces the massive Autocannon/20 for a Zeus Slingshot Gauss Rifle with two tons of ammo. Although doing slightly less damage it has a much larger effective range.

Cyclops 10-Qs are strong support units. Lacking the close in weapons and command suite of the 10-Z variant, this model instead capitalizes on a longer range weapon configuration and added armor.

==Description==

The most notable of all Cyclops variants, introduced in 2750, fits the 'Mech with a Collapsible Command Module strapped to its rear torso, allowing a fully operational headquarters bunker to be set up in fifteen minutes. In order to make room for the module the Autocannon/20 and its ammunition was removed from this variant. Irreparable damages suffered during the Succession Wars means less than half of those Cyclopses with a working B-2000 have an operable command module.

'''Mechs/DEI-S'''

==Description==

The Deimos was developed by the Snow Raven Clan and the Mech was first introduced during the middle of the 3060s, allegedly on the Kerensky Cluster world of Lum. However, Inner Sphere intelligence agencies stopped hearing rumors about the 'Mech during the Jihad and it faded from memory. In 3085, the Snow Ravens revealed the existence of the Deimos to the Inner Sphere. It is considered as the pride of the Clan making atleast one assigned to every touman. The S Configuration is specifically designed to meet the Ravens' need for a space-based 'Mech developed in 3086. The S configuration is almost identical to the C configuration with the exception of the ECM suite and the mech uses Laser Heat sinks for heat management.

'''Mechs/DVS-1D'''

==Description==

A Star League era mech designed to correct the flaws of the original Titan, the Devastator was rediscovered by the FedSuns in 3023. Powered by a 300 rated engine, the Devastator DVS-1D carries a pair of AC/10’s, with 2 Large Lasers and 4 Medium Lasers as secondary weapons. 18 tons of armor and 15 heat sinks round out the design.

'''Mechs/DW-LW-AP'''

==Description==

The variant piloted by Phelan Wolf at his Trial of Position to test out as a MechWarrior on 21 July 3051. Configured by Khan Natasha Kerensky (who was piloting the LRM variant of her Widowmaker in the same Trial). Different from the normal Lone Wolf, this variant has some weird experimental Rotary weapon system. Designed to ''delete'' infantry units.

Configured by Khan Natasha Kerensky (who was piloting the LRM variant of her Widowmaker in the same Trial). For long range, the Lone Wolf variant was armed with shoulder mounted twin LRM-20 launchers with 24 racks, first half being Swarm LRMs, backed up by a Gauss Rifle in left arm, with 16 slug coming from bins in the left torso. For close combat, the Lone Wolf carries three Medium Pulse Lasers in right arm, a stubby LB-X Autocannon/20 with 10 cluster rounds under-slung on right torso.

'''Mechs/DS-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Dire Wolf is one of the OmniMechs that became feared throughout the Inner Sphere during the initial Clan Invasion and rightly so. The Dire Wolf weighs in at an impressive one hundred tons and has a relatively slow cruising speed of 54 km/h provided by a 300 XL engine. Its speed and armor protection matches that of an Atlas, but it has superior potential firepower with fifty and a half tons of free pod space for weapons and equipment. It is these traits which saw the 'Mech christened Daishi (pseudo-Japanese for 'Great Death') by the criminal underbelly of the Draconis Combine, a name that would be proven grimly accurate time and time again.

'''Mechs/DW-W'''

==Description==

This Wolf's Dragoons variant is effective at both long and short range. For long range, it uses a Gauss Rifle, an ER Large Laser, and an LRM-20. At close range, an Ultra Autocannon/20, ER Small Laser, and a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers provide devastating firepower. Twenty double heat sinks allow the design to almost continually fire all of its weapons.

'''Mechs/DW-S'''

==Description==

The S configuration is intended for the close confines of urban and jungle warfare. The S configurations primary weapon is a massive LB-X Autocannon/20 which is capable of disabling most light and medium 'Mechs in a single blast. This is backed up by a single Large Pulse Laser to provide some long range firepower should the Dire Wolf S be caught in the open. Additional short range firepower is provided by five Medium Pulse Lasers and two Streak SRM-4 launchers. Two Anti-Personnel Pods and two Machine Guns provide exceptional anti infantry capabilities. The S configuration has added mobility with three jump jets allowing it to jump up to ninety meters.

The Hohiro configuration of the Dire Wolf is used by Hohiro Kurita and has a mixed long and short range weapons profile. For long range hitting power, an ER PPC and a Gauss Rifle provide overwhelming punch. To engage enemies at long to medium ranges, three Large Pulse Lasers are carried. One ER Small Laser and one Streak SRM-6 round out this configuration with some short range punch.

'''Mechs/DW-H'''

==Description==

A simple direct fire configuration of the Dire Wolf, the H configuration carries a pair of Gauss Rifles as its primary long range weaponry. These are backed up by two Heavy Large Lasers for medium to short ranges. Finally, for short range combat, the H configuration has a Medium Pulse Laser and a Flamer. All of this configuration's weapons are linked to a Targeting Computer, increasing their accuracy.

'''Mechs/DW-D'''

==Description==

The Dire Wolf is one of the OmniMechs that became feared throughout the Inner Sphere during the initial Clan Invasion and rightly so. The Dire Wolf weighs in at an impressive one hundred tons and has a relatively slow cruising speed of 54 km/h provided by a 300 XL engine. Its speed and armor protection matches that of an Atlas, but it has superior potential firepower with fifty and a half tons of free pod space for weapons and equipment. It is these traits which saw the 'Mech christened Daishi (pseudo-Japanese for 'Great Death') by the criminal underbelly of the Draconis Combine, a name that would be proven grimly accurate time and time again.

'''Mechs/EMP-8L'''

==Description==

This upgrade of the EMP-7L replaces the basic autocannons with paired LB-X Autocannon/10s reminiscent of the EMP-6A. Two captured Medium Re-engineered Lasers replace the Medium Pulse Lasers, and the ER Large Laser is swapped for a Plasma Rifle fed by two tons of ammunition. The four tons of LB-X munitions in the right torso are protected by CASE. Both the Stealth Armor and Triple Strength Myomer are retained from the 7L.

'''Mechs/EMP-7L'''

==Description==

Like the other Capellan variant, the 7L uses Stealth Armor and the attendant Guardian ECM, along with Triple Strength Myomers to take advantage of the high heat levels, all powered by a standard engine.

'''Mechs/EMP-6S'''

==Description==

This Lyran model is meant for close range and restrictive terrain. It carries two highly destructive LB-X Autocannon/20s that can create holes in an enemy's armor using slug rounds with ease, then exploit those holes to damage critical systems with the cluster rounds. Three Medium Pulse Lasers and a regular Medium Laser provide energy backup.

'''Mechs/EMP-6ME'''

==Description==

This custom variant was used by Lieutenant Colonel Anne-Marie McKormack during the conflict on Atreus. Based on the EMP-6M, the Mercury Elite mounted a C3 Slave in the head and a Snub-Nose PPC and Silver Bullet Gauss Rifle in each arm. Adding an extra double heat sink helps diffuse the heat load these weapons and the two torso-mounted Medium Pulse Lasers create. Unlike the EMP-6M this version doesn't mount Triple Strength Myomer.

'''Mechs/EMP-6M'''

==Description==

The variant produced for the Free Worlds League and Word of Blake, the 6M is built on an Endo Steel frame and is powered by a Light Fusion Engine. It uses a pair of arm-mounted Light Gauss Rifles and also upgrades the large lasers to ER models, making it incredibly effective at ranges where most other units cannot even attempt to return fire. It is most effective when another unit with an Improved C3 CPU is close and can provide targeting telemetry for the Emperor. In case other units close, the 6M mounts three Medium Pulse Lasers and an ER Medium Laser. Since it only carries ten double heat sinks, the 6M also makes use of Triple Strength Myomer. In order to make all of this possible, the 6M carries a half ton less armor.

'''Mechs/EMP-6L'''

==Description==

The first Capellan Confederation variant uses a standard fusion engine. This stand-off 'Mech is armed with a Gauss Rifle and ER PPC to snipe with so that it can take advantage of its Stealth Armor. The requisite Guardian ECM Suite enables the armor to function, while four Medium Pulse Lasers provide close support. Finally, Triple Strength Myomer takes advantage of the increased heat from the armor to potentially speed up the Emperor and make its already damaging physical attacks devastating.

'''Mechs/EMP-6A'''

==Description==

The Emperor is one of the earliest assault BattleMechs, dating back to 2502. The Emperor also bears the distinction of being the first 90+ ton BattleMech to mount jump jets (the famed Highlander began production in 2592). In 2612, StarCorps introduced an upgraded Emperor, EMP-6A designed for and distributed exclusively to Star League Defense Forces Royal Units. The Emperor was produced continuously until Marik forces destroyed StarCorps Industries facility with nuclear arms on Son Hoa during the Second Succession War. Production of the Emperor resumed in 3057 alongside the legendary Highlander.

'''Mechs/EXE-E'''

==Description==

In a logical step up from other, earlier variants the Executioner E sticks with the idea of being effective and deadly at all ranges. ERLLs and ATMs will grant massive firepower at long and medium ranges while a bunch of Heavy Medium and Heavy Small Lasers will grant close perimeter defense...or the bit of extra damage to finish an already damaged oponent.

==Description==

Fast, precise, deadly. The Executioner D(isco) makes use of its phenomenal agility to close in on its enemies...just to unleash a hell of fire on them in form of pulse lasers in all colors and sizes. LPL, MPL, SPL ... you name it, the EXE-D has it. Pilots be warned though, you better bring som chilled drinks as this one is running HOT!

'''Mechs/EXE-C'''

==Description==

Sometimes you just need to lob some missiles at them. The Executioner C trades direct hit firepower of its sister variants for a set of Artemis IV guided Long Range Missiles. But for everyone who believes to be able to sneak up on this monster: be warned it still fields the massive close range punch in form of an UAC/20.

==Description==

The Jack-of-all-trades variant. The Executioner B is set up to be effective in all ranges the battlefield can offer. With an ERPPC for extreme and long ranges and an absolutely devastating UAC/20 for closer range brackets, the B just executes its foes by brute force. Advanced targeting systems will make sure that there is nowhere to run...nowhere to hide.

The Fafnir is built on a lightweight Foundation Type 220 Endo Steel chassis that is capable of supporting the Fafnir's massive weapons payload and armor while weighing half as much as a standard chassis.

'''Mechs/GAR-E'''

==Description==

This variant makes use of Clan technology developed in the 3060s. An ATM 12 in the right arm has enough ammunition bins to make use of all of the types available to an Advanced Tactical Missile Launcher. Four Heavy Medium Lasers provide a powerful punch as short range, while a Streak SRM-6 can exploit those holes. A pair of ER Micro Lasers round out the offensive armament. A Targeting Computer makes the lasers more accurate.

'''Mechs/GAR-B'''

==Description==

Configured almost exclusively for long range combat, the B configuration of the Gargoyle carries a powerful Gauss Rifle backed up by an LRM-10 launcher linked to an Artemis IV FCS, allowing it to keep its distance from enemy units. For self defense at short ranges, the 'Mech has an SRM-4 launcher which is also enhanced with an Artemis IV FCS. The main drawback to this configuration is its over reliance on ammunition based weaponry, making it effective only so long as it has sufficient ammunition for its weapons.

'''Mechs/T-IT-N14R'''

==Description==

Developed by the Principality of Regulus during the Jihad, the Grand Titan Vengeance trades the weaponry and armor of the standard version for Hardened Armor, an Armored Compact Gyro, Armored Engine, and Armored Cockpit. The 'Mech also has a Full-Head Ejection System. All this protection, and a 60-meter jump radius, seems strange, but the Vengeance has a single Thumper Artillery Piece with two tons of ammo in a CASE II protected bin. This, along with two Clan built ER Medium Lasers, are the only weapons on the unit. This would seem a ridiculously light amount of weaponry, but intelligence reports suggest that the Vengeance uses the Thumper to launch nuclear warheads.

'''Mechs/T-IT-N11M'''

==Description==

The N11M model of the Grand Titan is a major modification of the design. The 'Mech carries as its primary long-range weapons a Light Gauss Rifle and an ER PPC which gives the 'Mech powerful long-range reach. The 'Mech has for short-range combat four Medium Pulse Lasers and two Streak SRM-4 launchers. It is also protected by a Guardian ECM Suite. This upgrade brings the Grand Titan to modern standards and makes it as powerful on the battlefield now as it was when it was first released.

'''Mechs/T-IT-N10M'''

==Description==

Designed by Vining Engineering and Salvage Team, the Grand Titan was concieved to take on and defeat any opponent. Built around a 400 rated XL Engine and an Endo Steel chassis, the Grand Titan has 18 tons of armour. The Grand Titan carries a large arsenal of weapons that allow it to work best at short to medium range. The longest-range weapon carried is an Artemis IV enhanced LRM-15 with 2 SRM 6's for closer range engagements.   Two Large Pulse Lasers, two Medium Pulse Lasers and two Small Pulse Lasers provide additional mid to short range firepower.  An AMS system provides a degree of protection from missiles.

'''Mechs/HTM-27T'''

==Description==

The Mech Daniel received was a bridging design between the early field-test HTM-26T and the later production HTM-27T. Dropping two tons of armor and outfitted with a bulkier and less refined Endo-Steel chassis, enough weight was saved to mount a pair of experimental Luthien Armor Works developed LB 10-X AC prototypes in it arms and a pair of Telos SRM-4 launchers in its chest.

'''Mechs/HTM-SAM'''

==Description==

The original version produced during 3039. Though lacking the LosTech of the HTM-27, the single production run of the original field-test Hatamoto-Chi completed on the verge of the War of 3039 came as a total shock to the attacking Lyran and Davion Forces. Since it was built on a standard chassis, the 26T had less armor, one less heat sink, and single ton of SRM ammunition in a standard ammo bin.

==Description==

The 27V, known within the Combine as the Hatamoto-Kaze, is a variant focused on long range combat. The 'Mech removes both of the SRM-6 launchers and replaces them with a pair of LRM-5 launchers, giving the Hatamoto-Kaze the ability to stay back from the battlefield and provide indirect fire.

==Description==

Constructed with an Earthwerks VOL Endo Steel chassis, fitted with CASE protected ammo bins and clad in fifteen and a half tons of Mitchell Argon armor, the Hatamoto-Chi shared the features which made its parent design a nearly indestructible zombie 'Mech. The main area that Combine was unable to replicate the Thug was the older design's advanced Double Heat Sinks, eighteen standard Heat Sinks giving the Hatamoto-Chi a high heat curve in heavy combat.

==Description==

The first OmniMech both designed and built by the Lyran Alliance. The inspiration for the Hauptmann is drawn from the Daishi OmniMech used by the Clans. Using information from captured Daishis and data gleaned from the construction of the Firestarter OmniMech, which was shared by the Draconis Combine, the end result is a powerful OmniMech capable of defending itself in most combat situations. The Hauptmann is built on a standard chassis and powered by a 285 fusion engine, adding to the 'Mech's durability as it cannot be killed by a side torso loss. The Hauptmann has eleven double heat sinks fixed on the chassis and can add more if needed in its various configurations. For protection, the Hauptmann carries eighteen and a half tons of armor and has CASE fixed in the right torso to protect against an ammunition explosion.

'''Mechs/HA1-OE'''

==Description==

The first OmniMech both designed and built by the Lyran Alliance. The inspiration for the Hauptmann is drawn from the Daishi OmniMech used by the Clans. Using information from captured Daishis and data gleaned from the construction of the Firestarter OmniMech, which was shared by the Draconis Combine, the end result is a powerful OmniMech capable of defending itself in most combat situations. The Hauptmann is built on a standard chassis and powered by a 285 fusion engine, adding to the 'Mech's durability as it cannot be killed by a side torso loss. The Hauptmann has eleven double heat sinks fixed on the chassis and can add more if needed in its various configurations. For protection, the Hauptmann carries eighteen and a half tons of armor and has CASE fixed in the right torso to protect against an ammunition explosion.

==Description==

At first glance, this mech seems just as a normal Highlander equipped with an MRM 40 missile system in its left torso, apart from the spikes and spray paintings such as 'Megas' with flames in the background of course. However, if someone takes a look into it's internals, you will see, that this MRM weapon system is literally melded into it's left torso and it's reload mechanism is sped up by some jury rigged stuff to shoot more missiles. Even the cockpit got changed to include 2 red buttons with words scratched above, such as 'more missiles' and 'all the missiles', which I believe probably controls the weapons firing modes.

==Description==

The Heavy Metal model of the Highlander is the signature ride of Rhonda Snord of the Snord's Irregulars mercenary unit. This customized Highlander features a number of recently reintroduced Lostech technologies. The most expensive example is the 275 XL Engine which saves weight for a heavy weapons payload, a Gauss Rifle in the right arm provides respectable punch at long range, while 13 Double Heat Sinks keep the design running cool.

'''Mechs/HGN-738'''

==Description==

Another upgrade by the Lyran Alliance following the civil war, the 738's largest weapon is its Heavy Gauss Rifle. The long-range missile launcher is replaced with an LRM-15, though it is guided by an Artemis IV FCS, with an ER Large Laser providing additional long range firepower. Should an enemy unit close, the 738 can bring a pair of ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-4 to bear.

'''Mechs/HGN-734'''

==Description==

The 734 Highlander emphasizes its role as an urban combat 'Mech, produced by the Lyran Alliance in the wake of the civil war. The Gauss Rifle has been replaced with a massive LB-X Autocannon/20, the medium lasers have been upgraded to ER Medium Lasers, the SRM-6 was upgraded to a streak version with another Streak SRM-6 launcher added, as well as an ER Large Laser. Upgrading the standard fusion engine to a new Light Engine and removing the LRM-20 launcher allowed these changes.

'''Mechs/HGN-732'''

==Description==

The Highlander is one of the most well-known Star League Defense Force assault 'Mechs, serving with distinction for almost two centuries since first entering service in 2592. Initially designed as a dedicated city and installation defender, the original model featured a variety of weaponry along with fifteen and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, but perhaps its most useful asset were the three Hildco jump jets giving it a jumping range of 90 meters. The heaviest 'Mech design to feature jump jets at the time, their original task was to allow the Highlander the ability to jump over inconvenient obstacles such as buildings and outpace other 'Mechs with a faster ground speed, but because of this increased mobility and its versatile weaponry the Highlander proved to be a capable fighter on any battlefield and within decades nearly every BattleMech regiment of the Regular and Royal Armies featured them. However it was during the design's initial trial runs that pilots began using these 'Mechs in what would infamously become known as the "Highlander Burial". Leaping into the air and landing directly on their enemy, a Highlander could literally drive a light 'Mech into the ground. So successful was this maneuver that the design team re-engineered the legs to withstand repeated death-from-above attacks and turned what had been a desperation move into an art form, giving Highlander pilots an additional psychological edge.

'''Mechs/HGN-IIC-C'''

==Description==

One of the most popular Star League BattleMechs, many a Highlander accompanied General Aleksandr Kerensky into exile. Some were mothballed, but many found their way into the toumans of the Clans. As technology advanced, the weapons systems were upgraded until the design known as the Highlander IIC finally emerged. With the use of newer, lighter weapons, the damage potential of the Highlander has roughly doubled. The IIC also contains enough ammunition that it rarely needs to conserve any during Trials. Clan scientists were forced to rearrange the placement of some weapons within the 'Mech to allow it proper ammo feeds, but the design is largely unchanged. It carries the maximum amount of Ferro-Fibrous armor that can be crammed on the frame, fourteen and a half tons. As with the original, the IIC carries enough jump jets to move up to ninety meters at a time, allowing MechWarriors to execute the Highlander Burial. The Highlander IIC C trades the standard variant's Gauss Rifle for a pair of Ultra Autocannon/10s, retaining the trio of Medium Pulse Lasers while removing the LRM-20's Artemis module and one of the left-arm Streak SRM-6 launchers.

As with the original, the IIC carries enough jump jets to move up to ninety meters at a time, allowing MechWarriors to execute the Highlander Burial. Like the original Highlander IIC, the B retains the Gauss Rifle and twin Streak SRM-6 racks, but replaces the single LRM-20 with twin LRM-15 racks in the right torso, removing one of the Medium Pulse Lasers to help free up the weight needed.

'''Mechs/IMP-4E'''

==Description==

A massive upgrade of the Imp, the 4E model carries two ER PPCs for long range direct fire, as well as an LRM-20 launcher with an Artemis IV Fire Control System. The 'Mech carries three ER Medium Lasers for intermediate range combat. The 'Mech also carries two Medium Pulse Lasers and two ER Small Lasers for close combat. Much like the original Clan models, the 21 heat sinks are double-strength and the engine is a standard model.

'''Mechs/IMP-1C'''

==Description==

Another early version based on the Imp 1B, this variant mounts a Gauss Rifle in the right arm. The Imp 1C uses the head mounted Small Laser of the Imp 1A in place of the Medium Pulse Laser. The Guardian ECM suite is still in the right torso. One heat sink is removed, giving the Imp 1C a total of seventeen double heat sinks.

'''Mechs/IMP-1B'''

==Description==

Similar to the Imp 1A variant, this model trades the Medium Pulse Lasers for Medium Lasers. It also trades the head mounted Small Laser for a Medium Pulse Laser. It keeps the ER PPCs and LRM-20 and Artemis IV system. The biggest change is the addition of a Guardian ECM suite in the 'Mech's right torso.

'''Mechs/IMP-1A'''

==Description==

The original Imp, introduced in 2793, carries an ER PPC and Medium Pulse Laser in the right and left torso. Supporting these weapons are 2 Medium Pulse Lasers mounted in the center torso and a Small Laser in the head. The left arm mounts another Medium Pulse Laser, while the right arm carries an Artemis IV enhanced LRM-20. The engine is a standard fusion model, and the missile ammunition is protected by CASE. This version was the original Imp design specified by Nicholas Kerensky and was intended for battlefield commanders.

==Description==

The personal 'Mech of Richard 'Fury' Fulton started life as an original JG-R9T1 model until a humiliating defeat against a hatchet armed Berserker in 3066. Fulton upgraded his 'Mech to the newer JG-R9T2 standard only for a lucky hit from a Shadow Hawk on his machine gun's ammo stores to gut his 'Mech, fleeing Solaris VII after his employer Bromley Stables collapsed in the aftermath of the Word of Blake's invasion. Reappearing on the Game World of Noisiel where with the aid of a former Bromley tech Fulton had his heavily damaged 'Mech rebuilt anew.

The Juggernaut's main armament is a trio of Large X-Pulse Lasers, one in each arm with one in its center torso, backed up by three Sutel Precision Line Medium X-Pulse Lasers divided between each arm and the head. Due to the 'Mech's lack of hand actuators, at knife-fighting range the Juggernaut is protected by a staggering twelve Machine Guns fed from two tons of reloads.

Originally a 3050's vintage Juggernaut, the JG-R9T14 is a ground-up refit almost entirely consisting of Clan technology. When first appearing in the arena, the JG-R9T14 was quickly nicknamed "The Dreadnougt" as it tore through the opposition with its twin Improved Heavy Large Lasers and experimental AP Gauss Rifle Batteries.

==Description==

A lumbering mountain of armor and weaponry, Solaris Arms' massive assault 'Mech definitely lives up to the name of Juggernaut in the Solaris Games. While not a flashy design, Solaris Arms kept up steady production of the design since the early 3050s. Sixteen and half tons of Valiant Chainmail armor protect a GM 270 Fusion Engine, propelling the 'Mech at fairly standard assault 'Mech speed of 54 kph.

==Description==

Argent Leviathan was commissioned by ComStar in 3060 as an exploratory upgrade to existing King Crabs. Largely driven by the logistical problems plaguing ComStar's thinly stretched armies, the KGC-AL prototype would carry eight extended range medium lasers and two large pulse lasers along with functional claws that would enable it to drag large battlefield salvage or even grasp its prey.

'''Mechs/KGC-010'''

==Description==

This version of the King Crab was created by the Star League to be a command 'Mech and introduced alongside the original 000 model in 2743. Conceived in secret between Cosara and the Terran Hegemony, it was an attempt to produce a deadly command 'Mech by mounting a pair of newly-developed Hellstar Magna PPCs in either side torso backed by bya pair of SRM-6's. A pair of newly developed LBX/10's replaced the standard autocannon. The 010 model was more than capable of taking down an Atlas, but the entire line left with Kerensky during the Exodus and even knowledge of the design's existence became lost during the Succession Wars.

==Description==

Apparently produced for the Word of Blake Protectorate Militia divisions in 3080, this unit's armor and weaponry is the same as the KGC-008. In fact the only difference between this unit and its cousin is the removal of the C3i computer and its replacement with a standard C3 Slave and a second CASE-protected ammunition bin.

'''Mechs/KGC-008'''

==Description==

Produced by Cosara Weaponries for the Word of Blake following their capture of the facility in 3069, the 008 uses the latest technologies available at the time. The autocannons have been upgraded to Heavy PPCs. The powerful weapons are backed up by paired Light Autocannon/2s, sharing one-ton of ammo in CASE-protected ammunition bin. Two ER Medium Lasers back up these guns. Like other Blakist units, a C3i Computer is included.A Guardian ECM Suite is also included. With seventeen double heat sinks and Jump Jets, this unit can jump and fire both of its main guns even with some heat to spare. Luckily this variant can be visually distinguished from others based on its more streamlined chassis, giving opponents some measure of warning.

'''Mechs/KGC-007'''

==Description==

Seemingly unaware that the Federated Commonwealth was merely a memory, StarCorps Industries combined technologies from the two halves of that sundered realm to create a new variant in 3071. The 007 hearkens back to the 005 with its use of a standard engine. Primarily a medium range powerhouse, this design carries twin Rotary Autocannon/5s and Light PPCs. The Plasma Rifle can cause massive heat buildup in enemies, while the Streak SRM-6 is adept at finding and exploiting holes in an opponent's armor. The inclusion of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor allows this variant to be the most heavily-armored variant of the King Crab, albeit not by much. That armor is needed, as the autocannons and missile launcher are fed from the same place, where those ammunition bins are the only critical systems, leaving them open to damage and explosion.

'''Mechs/KGC-005R'''

==Description==

This simple field refit of the 005, a result of the Jihad and efforts to upgrade old designs with what was available, was introduced in 3071. By removing the large laser, one of the Streak launchers, and a half-ton of armor, engineers were able to cram a Heavy PPC into the torso and upgrade the AC/20s to LB-X versions, each with three tons of ammunition. The remaining Streak system was reduced to a 4-tube launcher.

'''Mechs/KGC-005'''

==Description==

The 005 King Crab is an upgraded version of the 000 model introduced in 3062. The autocannons have been upgraded to LB-X Autocannon/20s and the large laser has been upgraded to an ER Large Laser. The LRM-15 has been completely removed from the ‘Mech and replaced with two Streak SRM-4s. The final upgrade is the inclusion of an improved C3 computer to allow the King Crab to work in concert with up to five other units sharing targeting telemetry.

'''Mechs/KGC-001'''

==Description==

One of the so-called Clanbuster variants developed in 3052 during the lead-up to the Battle of Tukayyid, ComStar's techs replaced the twin autocannons with two M-7 Gauss Rifles and four tons of ammo in the arms, trading a minor reduction in destructive capacity for greatly increased range. While retaining the LRM launcher the large laser was upgraded to a Tronel XIII Large Pulse Laser and two Hovertec Streak SRM-2s, split between the side torsos with a single ton of reloads each, were added. These changes were accomplished by using an extralight engine in place of the standard model.

Still armed with twin AC/20s, the -000b's double heat sinks and doubled ammo keeps the massive cannons firing far longer and more frequently making the -000b a true terror on the battlefield.

==Description==

The Legacy was produced as a testbed for new technologies, including the Ultra AC/10 and C3i Computer, at the request of Word of Blake Precentor Martial Cameron St. Jamais. The designers used a failed Star League 'Mech called the Rising Star as the base for the Legacy. They upgraded its targeting system and included the C3i, which allows six units to coordinate fire. Its thick armor protection, standard fusion engine, and CASE give the Legacy remarkable staying power on the battlefield. One of the weaknesses of the 'Mech is its slow speed compared to other 'Mechs of similar size, but the inclusion of jump jets sought to counter that with superior maneuverability.

'''Mechs/LGC-01'''

==Description==

The Legacy was produced as a testbed for new technologies, including the Ultra AC/10 and C3i Computer, at the request of Word of Blake Precentor Martial Cameron St. Jamais. The designers used a failed Star League 'Mech called the Rising Star as the base for the Legacy. They upgraded its targeting system and included the C3i, which allows six units to coordinate fire. Its thick armor protection, standard fusion engine, and CASE give the Legacy remarkable staying power on the battlefield. One of the weaknesses of the 'Mech is its slow speed compared to other 'Mechs of similar size, but the inclusion of jump jets sought to counter that with superior maneuverability.

'''Mechs/LGB-0W'''

==Description==

To add some speed to the Longbow, the OW variant removes two Medium Lasers and five and a half tons of armor. This allowed the 255 Fusion Engine to be replaced with a larger 340, increasing the top speed of the Longbow to 64 km/h, allowing the 'Mech to keep up with most heavy 'Mechs. The -0W is otherwise the same as the -7Q variant.

The original Longbow built in 2480, carried twin LRM-20s each with three tons of ammunition, supported by two Medium Lasers and a Small Laser. The Primitive Technology used limited the design's top speed to 54km/h, but this was deemed acceptable for a fire support unit.

'''Mechs/MSK-9HC'''

==Description==

A clan buster refit developed with Comstar’s mothballed 9Hb’s, the 9Hc was an attempt to fix the failings of it’s predecessor design in a cheap and easy to maintain upgrade package. Identifying the lack of CASE and adequate secondary weapons as the key weaknesses, the Comguard designers disregarded the other weakness – the designs slow ground speed – as being of lesser importance. The designers selected an Endo Steel skeleton as the preferred option, rejecting other more expensive solutions. CASE was installed for both ammo magazines and the designers upgraded the medium lasers to ER versions; installing an extra 3 in the process with double heat sinks incorporated to balance out the heat spike. The 5 completed prototypes served with distinction on Tukayyid, though the design never reached production status; with only 2 other conversions finished before the Word of Blake seized Terra and the remaining stocks of 9Hb’s. .

'''Mechs/MSK-9HB'''

==Description==

Built during the Amaris civil war, the Mackie 9Hb was a stopgap attempt to solve the SLDF's sudden dearth of advanced assault mechs. By taking Mackie 9H's from the remaining Hegemony stockpiles and upgrading them with surplus parts, the SLDF hoped to create a multi role assault mech for rear echelon and support duties; potentially freeing up better equipped machines that could be used on the frontlines. Equipped with 2 Thumper Artillery pieces and a cockpit command console, the 9Hb functions as both a command mech and an Artillery support platform. Though this design functions well as a support unit, it performs poorly in direct combat. Particularly devastating is the lack of CASE around the ammo magazines, a consequence of the rushed design process.

'''Mechs/MSK-9H'''

==Description==

Though most nations got rid of their cloned Mackies in favor of their own 'Mechs, the Hegemony was proud of their achievement. Moreover, many Hegemony militia units made extensive use of the first BattleMech, resulting in a continuous production of the first BattleMech right up until the Amaris Coup. Many of the various militia upgrades coalesced into the -9H, helped by the fact that Skobel continued to produce small quantities of this design. It mounts two Donal PPCs and an Imperator Autocannon/20, backed up by the pair of Starflash Medium Lasers. Nineteen tons of armor gave it full protection, allowing the 9Hs longevity.

'''Mechs/MSK-9GSK'''

==Description==

A unique redesign of the Mackie, this model was designed by Goliath Scorpion following their flight from the Homeworlds in 3080. Lacking advanced manufacturing capabilities in their new home and with severe losses among their Touman, the clan was forced to adapt much of the material they had recovered from Brian Caches during their evacuation efforts. A rearmed Mackie MSK-9H, this venerable mech is reskinned in clan spec armour and uses the more modern clan double heat sinks over it's SLDF vintage originals. The weapons loadout is an eclectic mix, built with the limited supplies that survived the flight from the homeworlds. Dual medium pulse lasers replace the original medium lasers, the PPC's are swapped for the Scorpions own improved heavy lasers and the large bore AC is removed in favour of a gargantuan HAG/40 of Hell’s Horses origin. The end result is a cheap conversion, perfect for garrison work and more than a match for the ragtag opponents found in the deep periphery. Unfortunately the limited number of 9H's and the loss of much of the Scorpion manufacturing capabilities, preclude full production of this model.

'''Mechs/MSK-6S'''

==Description==

Developed by the Terran Hegemony in the 25th century, the Mackie was the first true BattleMech. Based on advanced technology that the Hegemony Armed Forces (HAF) had been developing for decades under Director-General Jacob Cameron, the Mackie was the ultimate manifestation of Hegemony military might.

'''Mechs/MSK-5S'''

==Description==

The initial prototype Mackie was designated the MSK-5S, and carried a slightly different weapons load than the production model MSK-6S. Using an Autocannon/5 in the right arm instead of the AC/10, the MSK-5S also mounted a Large Laser in the center torso, rather than the twin Medium Lasers, and had two more heat sinks. Twenty tons of Primitive Armor protected the first generation Mackie. This armor, though heavier, provided less protection than later models. The MSK-5S was used by Colonel Kincaid in his now-famous combat trial versus the Merkava tanks.

The Marauder II was first built in 3012 in an attempt to take the firepower of the Marauder and combine it with the reliability and ruggedness of an assault chassis. Though this was piloted and decorated like a typical Pirate Mech, something is entirely off about this.

'''Mechs/MAD-BH'''

==Description==

This version is built with Clan technology similar to the Marauder II C. It uses a standard 300 rated Fusion Engine with sixteen tons of Ferro Fibrous armor and Endo Steel internal structure. It is armed with an ER PPC and two Medium Pulse Lasers in each arm. A Gauss Rifle sits in the right torso with two tons of ammunition, and a Targeting Computer is in the left torso for increased accuracy. It has a Clan-tech CASE system to protect the Gauss Rifle, and can jump 90 meters at a time.

==Description==

This Dark Age-era variant was created by the Capellan Confederation. It uses a light fusion engine to reduce vulnerability to engine destruction, and carries a Gauss Rifle in each arm. These are supported by a single torso mounted ER PPC. A Guardian ECM Suite powers the Stealth Armor that encases this design. It retains the ability to jump 90 meters at a time.

'''Mechs/MAD-4HB'''

==Description==

While the standard Marauder II, the MAD-5A, was built to spec for the Wolf's Dragoons to be a line combat unit and a traditional assault mech, the MAD-4HB is only one step removed from being a pirate design. Constructed by pirates after stealing a shipment of Marauder IIs meant for someone else, they removed the fancy equipment they couldn't maintain and filled in the holes with a frankly ungodly number of rockets, allowing the -4HB a punch that can instantly delete lesser mechs and even seriously damage mechs of its own caliber. After the rockets though, the -4HB has little firepower for an assault mech.

'''Mechs/MAD-4A'''

==Description==

The Marauder II was first built in 3012 in an attempt to take the firepower of the Marauder and combine it with the reliability and ruggedness of an assault chassis. This was achieved by generally upgrading the entire 'Mech's chassis to allow it to carry a much heavier armor and weapons load. The 'Mech was then armored with nineteen tons of armor, giving it protection that rivals that of the Atlas. Finally, to make up for the reduced mobility of the Marauder II, the 'Mech was outfitted with jump jets that give it a jumping capability of up to ninety meters. Blackwell Heavy Industries produced the design exclusively for Wolf's Dragoons until the end of the Fourth Succession War, when Jaime Wolf allowed them to sell to others.

'''Mechs/MAD-IIC-1'''

==Description==

Built around the Extended Range Particle Projector Cannon, one of the most powerful weapons in the Clan arsenal, the Marauder IIC's weapon layout is typical of the standard Marauder, each pod-like forearm carrying an ER PPC paired with Medium Pulse Lasers. Where the Marauder IIC differs is with its torso weaponry, replacing the top-mounted autocannon and its vulnerable ammunition-feed linkage with another ER PPC, and adding a set of four ER Small Lasers. Twenty-one double heat sinks keep heat levels manageable, with an enterprising MechWarrior able to use volley fire to keep up a steady barrage of fire.

Fitted with an 270 XL engine and twelve and half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, Knockout's heavy weapons array comes at the cost of field endurance, mounting only ten double heat sinks, two tons of LB-X autocannon munitions and single ton of LRM missiles.

==Description==

The -C variant of the Mauler is a modification that was made to the -1R model to allow it to carry a C3 Slave unit into battle. This is achieved by removing one ton of autocannon ammunition. This small modification allows the Mauler to share targeting data with friendly units and makes the 'Mech a highly effective sniper.

For close-range defense, the mech carries four Medium Pulse Lasers. The -3S's biggest downside is that the designers were forced to skimp on ammo, with the Snipers only 2 tons each.

'''Mechs/MAL-3R'''

==Description==

The -3R variant of the Mauler upgrades the design and addresses the concerns of pilots that used the -1R model. The four Autocannon/2s have been replaced with a pair of LB-X Autocannon/10s. The ER Large Lasers were removed from the design, but the MAL-3R retains the two LRM-15 launchers of its predecessor. Also incorporated in the design is a single Small Laser and a C3 Slave unit, the latter of which allows the -3R to use targeting data from units that are closer to the enemy and vice versa. It also has a ninety meter jump capability.

'''Mechs/MAL-2R'''

==Description==

The -2R variant of the Mauler uses relatively new weapons. The standard AC/2s are replaced with Ultra versions, doubling their potential damage. Paired ER Medium Lasers are fitted in arms formerly housing the ER Large Lasers. The missile launchers are reduced to smaller LRM-10s. A heavier standard fusion engine is utilized instead of the expensive XL.

'''Mechs/MAL-2P'''

==Description==

The Mauler MAL-2P should be considered a prototype. Unlike the -1P or MX90, the -2P carries a pair of Lasers in each arm; it's rumored that more than two can affixed if need be. Its twin LRM-10s allow it to send missiles at a greater distance and two Ultra Autocannon/5s give it long to close range support. Both the LRMs and UAC/5s have two tons of ammunition a piece, and like the -1P and MX90, the 2P has Cellular Ammunition Storage Equipment to help protect it from ammo explosions. Eleven Double Heat Sinks and a 270 Standard Engine round out the rest of it load out.

'''Mechs/MAL-1R'''

==Description==

The Mauler is armed with four Imperator Smoothie-2 Autocannon/2s as its longest ranged primary weapons. Individually, the damage the AC/2s deal is insignificant, but together they can steadily whittle away armor at extreme range. The 'Mech also carries two Shigunga LRM-15 launchers, adding much needed punch to the extreme reach of its four autocannons. The 'Mech also carries two Victory Nickel Alloy ER Large Lasers for added long range punch.

'''Mechs/MAL-1P'''

==Description==

The MAL-1P utilizes just about the same weapons as stock maulers, except this version carries a PPC in each arm. It retains both LRMs, downgrading these from the LRM-15s to LRM-10s, and keeps the MAL-1R's four Autocannon/2s. A extra-light 270 engine keeps it moving and eleven Double Heat Sinks keep the heat at bay.

==Description==

This overhaul replaces the lasers with Snub-Nose PPCs. The autocannons were replaced with the same number of Light Autocannon/5s, along with enough ammo bins to take advantage of special munitions. It's also fitted with an additional double heat sink, giving this version of the Mauler adequate heat-dissipation capabilities.

'''Mechs/NGA-A'''

==Description==

The Naga is a fire-support successor to the first-generation Woodsman OmniMech, but is an oddity in many ways. Most of what could be pod space for the design is actually taken up by a pair of fixed Arrow IV Artillery Systems.

'''Mechs/NSR-9JC'''

==Description==

In the late 3050's the Federated Commonwealth developed this offshoot of the standard NSR-9J in response to the proliferation of stealth technology. High end senors, targeting systems and actuators enable the NSR-9JC to deliver devastatingly accurate gauss rounds to even the most challenging targets. The XL engine of it's parent has been replaced with a standard model, greatly increasing survivability, which is further enhanced with spall liner and hardened arms. A C3 Master computer aids tactical coordination. For close range defense a pair of Medium X-Pulse lasers is mounted in each arm and an ER Small laser sits below the cockpit.

'''Mechs/NSR-9J'''

==Description==

The genesis of the Nightstar lies in the Amaris Civil War. The 'Mech itself was only produced until the the First Succession War, when both of the factories and engineers capable of producing the Nightstar were destroyed or killed. The Nightstar is armed to keep an enemy at standoff ranges. The primary weapons carried are a pair of Gauss Rifles, each of which can strip almost a ton of armor off an enemy unit. These are backed up by a ER PPC that is capable of hitting a target at six hundred and ninety meters. For defense at short ranges, the 'Mech has two Medium Pulse Lasers and an Small Laser.

'''Mechs/NSR-7J'''

==Description==

In the aftermath of the Amaris Civil War and the chaos of the Succession Wars, the Nightstar which was already rare and prized began to be unable to be repaired with its advanced components. Thus, the -7J downgrade was created to make use of damaged Nightstars that lacked the proper components. Without the delicate XL engine, the -7J could no longer carry its massive Gauss Rifles, instead carrying a pair of AC/10s. The remaining weaponry was downgraded, as well as the heat sinks being replaced with the weaker standard versions of the day. The two things that stayed the same however was the mech's ponderous speed and tremendous armor capability.

This variant of the Omen was introduced during the Dark Age in 3141. It carries the LB 10-X and AMS of the original design, but only carries one Medium Pulse Laser and one ER Medium Laser. The ATM-12 has been downrated to an ATM-9 with two tons of ammunition, and three heat sinks were removed. With the weight saved by removing these weapons and equipment, engineers added a HarJel III system to each torso.

'''Mechs/OM-1'''

==Description==

The Omen is a Clan Assault BattleMech that was created by Clan Snow Raven in the post-Jihad era. Designed as an all-purpose combat unit, the Omen is considered to be slower than the typical late thirty-first century Clan Assault BattleMech. However, its well-rounded weaponry and its 16.5 tons of Standard Armor allows it to be durable in combat. Also to help with its lack of speed, the Omen has been given three Jump Jets, which allow the 'Mech to tactically position itself up to 90 meters in the air and effectively use its weapons.

'''Mechs/OTN-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Osteon was developed as The Society's assault-class OmniMech. Designed as a flexible and heavily armoured support unit, Society designers focused on on survivability above other considerations. Eighteen tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor provide excellent protection against weapons fire. In addition, the Torso-Mounted Cockpit allows the Osteon's pilot to take advantage of the heavy center torso armor. To maximize the Osteon's damage potential, a Nova CEWS allows the unit to share targeting data with friendly units. This equipment is so valuable that it's permanently mounted in the 'Mech's head. The primary configuration uses a quartet of iATM 9 missile launchers as its primary armament. 13 tons of ammo stored in five separate  CASE II protected bays ensure the Mech stays in the fight for a long time.

'''Mechs/OTN-A'''

==Description==

The Osteon-A uses a trio of Mech Mortar/8s to lay down suppressing fire against conventional infantry, Battle Armor, ProtoMechs, and other light 'Mechs. Six tons of mortar ammunition provide an ample supply for a battle, but the lack of CASE or CASE II protection may concern some warriors. To augment this long range power, the 'Mech carries a single ER Large Laser in the left torso. For close in work, the Osteon-A carries a Medium Pulse Laser in the right torso, and each arm carries a pair of Improved Heavy Medium Lasers. To dissipate the additional heat from these weapons, the 'Mech carries a total of fourteen Double Heat Sinks.

'''Mechs/OSL-9R'''

==Description==

When Ostmann Industries first tried creating a heavier 'Mech than the Ostwar it resulted in the OstLord. It used much of the same components as the Ostwar but with size increased as needed. This 80 ton prototype assault 'Mech carried double LRM15 launchers, a Large Laser and two Medium Lasers and used a 320 rating fusion core. However, the design never went past prototype stage as it showed severe reliability problems during its trials and Ostmann Industries sold the few prototypes created on the second hand market before shutting the project down.

'''Mechs/PXH-IIC'''

==Description==

Originally built as a new assault class mech by Clan Steel Viper just three years before the introduction of the Omnimech, the Phoenix Hawk IIC is based on the venerable 45 ton Phoenix Hawk but almost twice as heavy at 80 tons. The Phoenix Hawk IIC features as close as possible ground speed and agility to the original Phoenix Hawk making it an effective fast interdiction unit.

'''Mechs/C-SRP-OD'''

==Description==

The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot. Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. The Seraph D is best at medium to long range, as it carries two Heavy PPCs and one Light PPC. Like the Dominus variant, the Luminos can jump up to 150 meters using improved jump jets that enable it to get into a good sniping position. Three Medium Pulse Lasers and a Small Laser are used defensively in the event an enemy units gets inside the minimum range of the PPCs. A Flamer provides effective anti-infantry defense.

'''Mechs/C-SRP-OE'''

==Description==

The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot. Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. The Seraph E uses two experimental Thunderbolt 20s, though it only has enough ammunition to fire each about nine times. Backing these up is a Snub-Nose PPC.

Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. This variant uses a Heavy PPC to deliver a strong punch, and a Plasma Rifle to deal both damage and heat. An ER Medium Laser and a Medium Pulse Laser provide close support, while the Target Acquisition Gear threatens opponents with homing artillery. A Targeting Computer helps these weapons find their mark, and Improved Jump Jets allow the Seraph Dominus to move up to a hundred fifty meters at a time.

The light assault 'Mech of the Celestial series of OmniMechs, the Seraph is somewhat slow for its weight, but it attempts to make up for that with the inclusion of Triple-Strength Myomer that enables the 'Mech to speed up to 64 kph when it runs hot. Like the other Celestials, the Seraph makes use of a light fusion engine and a small cockpit, though other newer technologies are present only in its weaponry. As with the other Celestials, a C3i Computer is included. Though the Comminus variant is quite powerful against conventional units, it sacrifices little firepower against other 'Mechs. An MRM 40 is useful against either type of opponent, though it is more difficult to aim than other weapons. A Heavy PPC and two ER Medium Lasers work well against hardened targets. A Plasma Rifle deals heavy damage against enemy units, but is especially potent against infantry. Also heavily damaging to unarmored troops are the pair of Flamers. To protect the Seraph C from enemy electronics, it mounts a Guardian ECM Suite.

==Description==

This variant of the Shrike was introduced in 3116. The Shrike 3 is similar to the standard model, save the swapping out of the 'Mech's autocannons for pair of Extended Range Particle Projection Cannons. Malvina Hazen, Jade Falcon Star Colonel and later Khan was a legendary Shrike MechWarrior. She named her BattleMech the Black Rose.

'''Mechs/SRK-1'''

==Description==

The Shrike is outfitted with a powerful Targeting Computer that allows it to bring accurate firepower to bear on the battlefield. It has a hard-hitting armament that gives the 'Mech a powerful sting in combat at most ranges. A Long Bow LRM-10-rack allows pilots to engage enemies at long range, and two Type 9 Ultra Autocannon-5s are effective against even other assault-class Mechs. Lastly, two Series 2b ER Large Lasers provide a fairly powerful punch should the other weapon systems deplete their ammunition. The design owes its large weapon capacity to due use to its Endo Steel construction and its large 380-rated Extra-Light Fusion Engine. Engineers enhanced the design by adding a Partial Wing, giving the Shrike extra jump capacity as well as additional cooling abilities under normal atmospheric conditions.

'''Mechs/STK-M'''

==Description==

Implied to be a Stalker piloted by J. Elliot Jamison, the Misery Hero 'Mech retains the STK-3F's twin Medium Lasers in each arm, right torso mounted SRM-6 and center torso mounted Large Laser but removes the remaining SRM-6 and LRM-10s to mount a mammoth Gauss Rifle in the left torso. Carrying two tons each of Gauss rounds and SRM missiles, twenty-two single heat sinks strive to keep the Misery in the thick of combat.

'''Mechs/STK-5M'''

==Description==

An upgrade originating from the Free Worlds League, the 5M variant of the Stalker was introduced in 3050 using moderate amounts of Star League technology. Most of the weaponry was retained but both large lasers were removed for a single Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Laser placed in the 'Mech's centerline and a Narc Missile Beacon in the left torso accompanied by two tons of reloads, allowing the Stalker to tag enemy units with homing beacon and direct friendly missile fire onto them. The seventeen double heat sinks of the 5M afford it far greater heat efficiency than the twenty single heat sinks of previous models, although it still could not handle firing all of its weaponry simultaneously, and an additional ton of armor was added for survivability. Other changes included the use of proprietary components such as an Irian E.A.R. communications system, Riese-456 armor and a Irian Chassis Class 30. Unfortunately the designers of the new 5M dismissed the inclusion of CASE, a factor which led directly to the deaths of several Stalkers during the Clan Invasion due to ammunition cook-offs caused by overheating and weapon penetrations.

==Description==

Based on the original Star League-era BattleMech, the Stalker II is a complete top-to-bottom redesign that takes advantage of technological advancements gained since the last era of open warfare ended. These efforts resulted in the Stalker II, giving troops an incredibly durable assault 'Mech that is able to withstand horrific amounts of punishment while keeping the original Stalker's success, which was it's variants that used Star League-era fire control systems. In order to recapture this particular aspect of the old design, the Stalker II was fitted with a modern Targeting Computer.

==Description==

A variable range variant, the Stone Rhino 4 uses an XL Engine to provide weight savings for four LRM 10s to lay down impressive long range fire. Backing these up are a pair of Ultra AC-10s for mid-range engagements. From there, four ER Medium Lasers provide a solid short range punch. Lastly, four Machine Guns provide anti-infantry support. These combine to make a solid and well rounded configuration.

'''Mechs/STR-2'''

==Description==

In order to plug holes in their touman, Clan Goliath Scorpion scientists revisited the Behemoth. Like Clan Smoke Jaguar before them, they upgraded and improved upon the design. This version used an Extra-light Engine to mount a pair of Thunderstroke Series 2b Gauss Rifles along the top of the 'Mech. Each arm carried a Series 4D-2 Heavy Large Laser, a Series 22a Heavy Medium Laser, and a General Systems Heavy Small Laser. It retained the shock-absorbing cowls of the original. Another pair of Heavy Mediums protected the rear of the 'Mech. A head-mounted Shield-3 Anti-Missile System defended against missiles, while an Anti-Personnel Pod in each leg discouraged unarmored infantry. This design had jump jets, nineteen tons of armor, and a meager sixteen double heat sinks.

==Description==

The design featured Large Pulse Lasers in each arm, twin Gauss Rifles mounted behind flip-open circular firing ports on each side torso, and an almost superfluous Small Pulse Laser located above the cockpit. The Stone Rhino also sported an interesting feature; each arm contained a retractable, shock-absorbing cowl covering the weapon barrels. This allowed MechWarriors to use the arms as battering rams without damaging the weaponry.

'''Mechs/SNV-BR'''

==Description==

While feared by the Inner Sphere, the Supernova design was born out of necessity in an attempt to address ammunition shortages by changing the original King Crab design to an all-energy loadout. The Boiler is a customized Supernova variant that seeks to re-engineer the Supernova back to the original King Crab loadout using Clan technology, essentially making the Boiler a 'King Crab IIC'. It mounts an Ultra AC/20 in each arm supported by a Large Pulse Laser in the right torso and an LRM-15 rack in the left. As it was built upon the frame of the standard Supernova, it retains the jump jets but mounts only seventeen double heat sinks. Like its progenitor, the Boiler lacks field endurance, carrying only two tons of Ultra Autocannon rounds and one ton of LRM reloads.

'''Mechs/SNV-A'''

==Description==

Apparently based on the Supernova-2, the Supernova-A retains only a single ER Large Laser in each arm, mounting an Artemis IV FCS-equipped LRM-20 and Streak SRM-6 launcher in each torso. With a targeting computer linked to the large lasers, three tons of LRM missiles and four tons of Streak reloads give the A variant good endurance. Keeping the classic jump jets and boosting armor over primary variant, an Endo Steel frame and fitting only seventeen double heat sinks are used to free up the extra weight required for the missile launchers.

'''Mechs/TLR1-OS'''

==Description==

A rare and special variant of the Templar, the TLR1-OS was redesigned around a BattleMech Sword and geared for close-range combat. An Ultra Autocannon/10, a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers, and a Small Laser back the sword up in close-range combat. THe mech's only concession to longer range combat are a pair of Large Pulse Lasers. Pilots of the -OS generally rely on the intimidation factor of the sword to keep their enemies in line.

==Description==

With a noticeable lack of OmniMechs designed in the Federated Suns, Field Marshal Duke George Hasek went over the heads of the Department of the Quartermaster and commissioned Kallon Industries to design an assault OmniMech and backed the project with his own financial resources. The resulting 'Mech is a force to be reckoned with on the modern battlefield.

'''Mechs/TN-10-OR'''

==Description==

The Tenshi, ("Angel" in japanese), is an Assault Class OmniMech, which was manufactured during the early thirty-second century for the Draconis Combine's armed forces. A product of House Kurita's hidden efforts to rebuild its decimated 'Mech regiments, the Tenshi was designed to use resources found within the Combine. The Tenshi was first deployed among the ranks of the Ghost Regiments in the early 3100s, its deployment with a less-renowned brigade was part of the DCMS' two-fold effort of testing the 'Mech while also providing a fire-wall to save face should the design prove to be a failure in combat. One of its first deployments was in 3103, when the 1st Ghost conducted a raid on the Ghost Bear Dominionworld of Grumium. The eight Tenshis among the Ghosts' ranks performed well, with most of their numbers returning to the Combine with stolen Clan technology. Among the Tenshi's design features is its durability and having a heavy equipment payload. The designers saw fit to equip the 'Mech with a Compact Gyro and 18.5 tons of Standard Armor. The Tenshi also uses a number of new technologies that had finally entered production in the decades preceding the Jihad. The use of an Endo-Composite internal structure and a Light Fusion Engine granted the design a huge pod capacity of 48 tons. However, this large capacity had come at a price; that price being a slightly lower maximum speed than other comparable designs of the era."

==Description==

The Tenshi, ("Angel" in japanese), is an Assault Class OmniMech, which was manufactured during the early thirty-second century for the Draconis Combine's armed forces. A product of House Kurita's hidden efforts to rebuild its decimated 'Mech regiments, the Tenshi was designed to use resources found within the Combine. The Tenshi was first deployed among the ranks of the Ghost Regiments in the early 3100s, its deployment with a less-renowned brigade was part of the DCMS' two-fold effort of testing the 'Mech while also providing a fire-wall to save face should the design prove to be a failure in combat. One of its first deployments was in 3103, when the 1st Ghost conducted a raid on the Ghost Bear Dominionworld of Grumium. The eight Tenshis among the Ghosts' ranks performed well, with most of their numbers returning to the Combine with stolen Clan technology. Among the Tenshi's design features is its durability and having a heavy equipment payload. The designers saw fit to equip the 'Mech with a Compact Gyro and 18.5 tons of Standard Armor. The Tenshi also uses a number of new technologies that had finally entered production in the decades preceding the Jihad.

'''Mechs/THG-13K'''

==Description==

The 13K is a variant of the 12E that removes many of the traditional strengths of the Thug to increase its damage potential. Introduced in 3068 , it removes the missiles and trades the standard engine for an XL. This, combined with the loss of a half-ton of armor and one of the heat sinks, reduces the much-vaunted survivability of the Thug to make room for three Heavy PPCs. Though this gives the 13K great damage potential, it can quickly overwhelm its heat dissipation system. Two Medium Pulse Lasers provide close range defense in case an enemy gets within the minimum range of the PPCs and an Improved C3 CPU enables it to share targeting telemetry with other units equipped with the same.

Piloted by mercenary Jose Magellan during the fall of the Star League, this Thug variant replaces the standard engine with an extralight model. The PPCs are replaced by ER Large Lasers. In the space freed by the XL Engine, Magellan installed three more SRM-6 launchers, for a total of five. The cockpit adds a Command Console to allow a Rim Worlds commander to see the entire battlefield. Four jump jets allow the Thug Jose to cover 120 meters at a time. Finally, a Null Signature System interfered with SLDF targeting systems.

'''Mechs/THG-11E'''

==Description==

The Thug was designed by Maltex Corporation as a direct competitor to the popular Warhammer BattleMech. First seeing production in 2572, the Thug sought to directly address some of the challenges which faced the Warhammer, chief of which was to increase armor protection without sacrificing firepower. The Thugs long range striking power comes from a pair of arm mounted PPC’s. Backing up the PPCs are two SRM-6 launchers mounted in either side torso with one ton of CASE-protected reloads. Eighteen double heat sinks comfortably dissipate the enormous heat generated by the PPC’s while an Endo Steel frame allows it to carry fifteen and a half tons of armor.

'''Mechs/THG-10E'''

==Description==

The 10E is a downgraded version of the 11E produced by Earthwerks Incorporated following the destruction of Maltex's facilities in 2835. The primary changes come from the loss of the double heat sinks, CASE, and the Endo Steel structure. To compensate for the weight needed for a standard structure, the SRMs have been downgraded from six tube launchers to SRM-4s. In addition, the Thug lost one ton of ammunition.

==Description==

The Titan II is a BattleMech produced by Kressly WarWorks on Epsilon Eridani for the Word of Blake's Protectorate Militia. First identified by the Successor States in 3071, the Titan II owes its existence to the Titan, a prototype that dates to 2765. Like the original, the Titan II has a top speed of 54 km/h and nineteen tons of standard armor. Since the 'Mech is produced for the Blakists' garrison forces, it makes no use of expensive, weight-saving technologies. It also lacks the advanced electronics that have become the hallmark of Word military forces.

==Description==

The Tomahawk is an assault-class OmniMech designed by Clan Wolf in 3065. By September of that year, a few prototypes had been built and were being tested in trial runs. One these prototypes was piloted by Nathan Wolf in a Circle of Equals on Tamar when he attained the rank of Star Colonel. Although he was victorious against a Thor, it was noted that the Tomahawk still suffered from numerous system errors and gremlins and was not yet ready for mass production. Still, Nathan retained the 'Mech for his subsequent assignment to Omega Galaxy and successfully piloted it in combat on Novo Cressidas in the Star's End system on 11 April 3064.

'''Mechs/THWII-PRIME'''

==Description==

The Tomahawk II is designed around the use of a DSAM Endo 10-Composite internal structure, which gives the design its cavernous pod capacity of 56 tons. The 'Mech is powered by a 300-Rated Starfire Extra-Light Fusion Engine, giving it a maximum speed of 54 kph. Protecting the engine and the Tomahawk II's other vitals is 19 tons of Advanced/3 standard armor, providing nearly maximum protection against enemy fire.

==Description==

The Z variant was developed by The Society. Four iATM 12 systems provide heavy firepower, while the Nova CEWS and Light TAG provide additional targeting data and target designation abilities. Most frightening is the Turkina Z's ten tons of ammunition space which insures it will stay in the fight for a long time.

'''Mechs/TKR-U'''

==Description==

Designed for space operations, this Turkina U configuration mounts several experimental systems. A BattleMech HarJel System protects the torso against breachess. A Coolant Pod can quickly dissipate the heat built up by the ten ER Small Lasers, twin LRM-15s, and ATM-9. An Active Probe allows the Turkina U to find enemy forces, and the Talons mounted in each leg prevent the Turkina from floating away from the hull. To provide additional protection the Liquid Storage tanks, Harjel systems, and Coolant Pod have all been armored against enemy fire.

'''Mechs/TKR-C'''

==Description==

Designed for fighting Inner Sphere forces, the Turkina C is optimisied for Urban combat. An LB-X Autocannon/20 and twin Large Pulse Lasers can open up holes in enemy 'Mechs, while the Streak SRM-6 and paired Medium Pulse Lasers exploit them. Paired Anti-Personnel Pods, Machine Guns, and Flamers discourage conventional forces from closing. An Active Probe finds most hidden units, ensuring the MechWarrior is rarely surprised.

'''Mechs/VQR-7V'''

==Description==

Based on the King Crab, and built in the same factory that first produced the Mackie, the Vanquisher has a legendary pedigree. The Vanquisher has its genesis in the development of reverse engineered Improved C3 Computers. Once the Word of Blake had perfected their version of C3i, Cameron St. Jamais contacted Skobel MechWorks and contracted them to produce a 'Mech that would showcase the features of the new system. The Vanquisher was the result of that request. In order to allow it to carry as heavy a payload as possible without sacrificing durability, the 'Mech is built on a Hollis Alteration Mark VI Endo Steel that carries a Vlar 300 fusion engine, which propels the 'Mech to a top speed of 54 km/h. The Vanquisher is protected by nineteen and a half tons of armor with CASE in both side torsos to protect the 'Mech from going down in an ammunition explosion.

'''Mechs/VTR-9B-S'''

==Description==

Used by the 5th Benjamin Regulars commander on Royal during the War of Davion Succession, this Victor-9B variant removes the AC/20 and replaces it with an AC/10 and two more tons of ammo. The Medium Lasers have been removed and replaced with three Medium Pulse Lasers. The Victor variant is equipped with ten Double Heat sinks, and the remaining tonnage has been devoted to additional armor.

Some idiot got a hold of this poor ''Victor'', I'm not sure what all they did to his but somehow they strapped this monstrous thing on the right arm. They also scrawled ''The RACtor 9000'' in giant letters across the chest and drew a toothy grin over the cockpit glass. Yeah you heard me they painted over the duraplast. They also welded a damn flag pole onto the shoulder for flying a pirate flag.

'''Mechs/VTR-9K2'''

==Description==

After his son was killed in the Taurian Concordat invasion of the Federated Suns, Benedict St. James had his VTR-9K refitted with experimental weapons and equipment to allow him to take his revenge. Replacing the standard weapons with a Long Tom Cannon and two Medium X-Pulse Lasers, St. James' Victor can inflict massive amounts of damage on his prey. The 'Mech's jump jets had to be removed to make way for the weapons load, and technicians equipped it with a patchwork of Ferro-Fibrous and Standard Armor as another weight saving measure. A Supercharger mounted on the engine provides the Victor with unexpected bursts of speed.

The 'Mech also carries two Medium Pulse Lasers and a SRM-4 launcher for close combat. In order to make these changes possible, the 9K is built on an Endo Steel chassis. With the weight saved the 'Mech also carries an additional ton of armor.

'''Mechs/VTR-9DB'''

==Description==

The VTR-9Db replaces the three external heat sinks of the VTR-9D with two small lasers and and extra medium pulse laser, increasing it's medium to close range arsenal. The increased heat and reduced cooling capacity is addressed by converting the 'Mech to use double heat sinks. A bit more added armor and the removal of the CASE in the right torso finishes up the design changes.

'''Mechs/VTR-9B(C)'''

==Description==

A Clan-tech retrofit of SLDF VTR-9B Victors intended for second-line and solahma troops, this variant swaps the large bore autocannon for a Gauss Rifle, the SRM rack for an advanced Streak SRM-4 and standard Medium Lasers for paired ER Medium Lasers. Unlike the similarly armed 9D and 9K variants, lighter Clan weaponry allows this swap without the need to utilize an Endo Steel chassis and still leaves the refit two ton under weight.

'''Mechs/VTR-11D'''

==Description==

Production began on the 11D on New Valencia during the FedCom Civil War. Powered by a Light Engine, the 11D adds an additional ton and a half of armor over that on the 10D. Two ER Large Lasers provide long-range firepower and the Streak SRM-4 is retained. The autocannon is replaced with a Rotary Autocannon/5 and three tons of ammunition in a CASE-protected bin. A C3 Slave allows integration with a C3 unit. Fifteen double heat sinks are able to effectively manage the heat levels.

'''Mechs/VTR-10S'''

==Description==

The 10S is armed with a mammoth Heavy Gauss Rifle, split between the right and center torsos, supported by a standard Gauss Rifle in the right arm, SRM-4 in the left torso and twin ER Medium Lasers in the left arm. Carrying the usual Victor weapons load-out in addition to the Heavy Gauss Rifle is made possible through the use of an Endo-Steel frame and fragile 320-rated Extralight engine. Lacking the jump jets most Victors are renowned for, the 10S mounts an Anti-Missile System and is clad in thirteen tons of standard plating. The 10S carries three tons of Heavy Gauss reloads, two of standard Gauss rounds and a single ton of SRM and AMS ammo each.

'''Mechs/VTR-10L'''

==Description==

The 10L is armed with a Gauss Rifle as its primary long ranged weapon. This is backed up by three ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-6 launcher for close combat. The 'Mech carries an ECM Suite as part of its Stealth Armor system, which allows it to reduce its radar signature and makes the 'Mech harder to target, especially at long range, and also four jump jets that allow the 'Mech to seize the high ground, making this variant of the Victor an excellent sniper.

'''Mechs/VTR-10D'''

==Description==

A more recent variant of the Victor produced on New Valencia, the 10D is an excellent close combat 'Mech. The 10D variant has a powerful Ultra Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon. This is supported by two ER Medium Lasers and a Streak SRM-4 to finish off a damaged target. The 10D is also capable of jumping up to one hundered and twenty meters, making it an excellent urban combat machine.

'''Mechs/VKG-RX'''

==Description==

A much tougher BattleMech than its predecessor, the Viking IIC is protected by a massive 31 tons of GC Hardened Slab Armor. This is a dense and tough hardened armor, which while providing considerable protection in combat also slows the 'Mech down. Its lack of speed would make the Viking IIC unpopular with Clan warriors, who prefer swifter machines in combat. The foundation of toughness is also found in its GC Type 2C Endo Steel skeleton and a General Motors 270-Rated Fusion Engine.

'''Mechs/WMR-IIC-9'''

==Description==

The original Warhammer was designed as an assault BattleMech. However, it had been superseded by later and heavier 'Mech designs, though it remained a powerful weapons platform. The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. This version drops the ER PPCs and replaces them with experimental Rotary AC/5s. An XXL Fusion Engine provides enough power for a top speed of 86km/h. The RACs are backed up by a pair of ER Medium Lasers and ER Small Lasers, and the missile launcher is now an LRM-10. In addition to the Ferro-Fibrous Armor, an ECM Suite in the head disrupts enemy electronics.

==Description==

The original Warhammer was designed as an assault BattleMech. However, it had been superseded by later and heavier 'Mech designs, though it remained a powerful weapons platform. The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. Developed by Clan Snow Raven this variant is unique in that it's intended for vacuum operations. The weapons are a mix of pulse and extended range lasers but the main firepower comes from the arm mounted ER PPCs. A single ATM-6 launcher provides additional long or short range firepower.

'''Mechs/WMR-IIC-12'''

==Description==

The original Warhammer was designed as an assault BattleMech. However, it had been superseded by later and heavier 'Mech designs, though it remained a powerful weapons platform. The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. This version uses an XXL Engine to reach top speeds of 86km/h. Its weapon load hearkens back to the original Warhammer, carrying ER PPCs in the arms and a single ER Medium Laser and ER Small Laser in the left and right torso. An SRM-6 is also carried in the right torso, and an ECM Suite disrupts enemy communications and targeting. This version is protected by Heat-Dissipating Armor.

The original Warhammer was designed as an assault BattleMech. However, it had been superseded by later and heavier 'Mech designs, though it remained a powerful weapons platform. The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. Another Dark Age variant, this model carries a Heavy Large Laser in each arm, an ER Medium Laser in the head, and a Streak SRM-6 in the side torsos. To protect it from enemy infantry, each leg mounts a single A-Pod.

The original Warhammer was designed as an assault BattleMech. However, it had been superseded by later and heavier 'Mech designs, though it remained a powerful weapons platform. The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. Introduced in the Dark Age era, this version carries four ER Large Lasers supported by twin SRM-6 launchers. A single ER Small Laser rounds out the armament. It's powered by a standard fusion engine, but uses an Endo Steel frame and Ferro-fibrous armor.

'''Mechs/Y-H9GC'''

==Description==

The Yu Huang, named for the Jade Emperor that rules the Heavenly Court in the ancient Chinese pantheon, debuted with the promise from Sun-Tzu Liao that 'it shall sit in judgment over a battlefield, meting out justice to those who would transgress against us'. To live up to the promise of the Chancellor of the Capellan Confederation, the Yu Huang carries some of the most advanced technologies available at the time of its initial production. The Yu Huang is built on a Chariot Type II Endo Steel chassis and carries a Hermes 360 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The 'Mech is capable of jumping up to one hundred and twenty meters with its four Rodan 90 jump jets.

'''Mechs/ZEU-5T'''

==Description==

The Zeus 5T is an original model Zeus and makes use of Star League technology to make a much more deadly mech. Just as fast as the -6S, the -5T switches the autocannon for a devastating array of energy weapons which combined with the -5T's double heat sinks is a brutal combination.

'''Mechs/ZEU-11S'''

==Description==

An evolution of the Zeus -9T based on lessons learned during Defiance's Zeus-X program, the new ZEU-11S is a mixture of technologies that blurs the Inner Sphere and Clan divide. Using Clan specification extended-range lasers, an extralight engine and LRM 15 launcher built on-site, the -11S seamlessly integrates these onto the frame of the -9T, although mating the Sphere-made Artemis FCS onto the ClanTech launcher did prove to be a challenge. Everything on the -9T was improved, especially armor protection, with the 'Mech's resilience being further bolstered by a compact gyro and CASE II.

'''Mechs/ZEU-10WB'''

==Description==

This variant was produced by the Word of Blake following their seizure of Hesperus II during the Jihad. Rolling off assembly lines six months after the planet's capture, it was armed with a pair of Heavy PPCs, supplemented by an ER large laser, four ER medium lasers and fourteen tons of ferro-fibrous armor. These new additions were made possible by the inclusion of an XL Gyro and Light Fusion Engine, while seventeen double heat sinks were included for heat management.

In 2775 as Aleksander Kerensky's forces were tightening the noose around the Amaris Empire, weapons development became increasingly frantic in hopes of finding a miracle weapon to turn the tides of the war. The most well known of these is the Matar, commonly referred to as Amaris' Folly, an attempt to create a BattleMech able to withstand an entire company.

==Description==

So look Commander, this thing is a gigantic beast but its really an IndustrialMech SLDF Prototype made for working on DropShips that is over 300 years old. I am not sure how _these_ fraggers have kept the thing running for 300 years, but I'm pretty sure one of the arms is like 6 legs of various UrbanMechs welded together. The ''armor'' is just the chest pieces of what has to be dozens of other mechs welded onto this freakshow. I have no idea why but the locals have been using it to build barns. For cows.

'''Mechs/CM-XXX2'''

==Description==

So look Commander, this thing is a gigantic beast but its really an IndustrialMech SLDF Prototype made for working on DropShips that is over 300 years old. I am not sure how _these_ fraggers have kept the thing running for 300 years, but I'm pretty sure one of the arms is like 6 legs of various UrbanMechs welded together. The ''armor'' is just the chest pieces of what has to be dozens of other mechs welded onto this freakshow. I have no idea why but the locals have been using it to build barns. For cows.

==Description==

Manufactured in small numbers by Skobel MechWorks from their facilities in the Russia region of Terra prior, the Omega represented the first truly viable superheavy BattleMech design to appear on the battlefield. Although the Omega was a prototype, almost thirty of the huge 'Mechs were produced by Skobel prior to the Superheavy manufacturing wing of their Russian facility being destroyed.

The Kugelblitz, also known as the Hypernova, Superluminous Supernova, or ''Type 1A Supernova'' is a gigantic Supernova chassis. Nothing really out of the ordinary until one checks the armor plating on it, mounting WarShip class ''Ferro-Carbide Lamellor'', this expensive armor is capable of protecting a mech's internals without issue, but the price to maintain the armor is only something even the richest of Clan Diamond Shark might have an issue.
