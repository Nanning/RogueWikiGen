Mechs are big fighting robots. Presumably if you've installed the mod with every crazy piece of equipment that Battletech has ever published you know this. In Roguetech a mech chassis is close to a blank slate. A chassis will have a certain tonnage and distribution of weapon hardpoints; it will have a number of internal slots dedicated to mandatory equipment like life support and arm and leg actuators. Other than that, the world is your oyster. 

Mechs come in two main flavors. Standard mechs are almost entirely customizable, but altering or repairing them takes significant amounts of money and time. Omnimechs, have a fixed set of internal components but can be repaired quickly and can be refit with a different loadout almost instantaneously. Omnimechs tend to have vastly more weapon hardpoints than standard mechs to facilitate that flexibility.

Roguetech adds Specialist slots, found just to the left of the head, as a method for handling Mech quirks, as well as "carried" (backpack, hands, etc.) items. These quirks contain Chassis unique buffs, which can affect anything from weapon systems to repair costs. 

Fixed equipment cannot be removed from a mech. In exchange for this lack of flexibility these components are often rare or better than stock versions. Also, these components cannot be permanently destroyed. If destroyed in battle simply repairing the chassis will bring back the fixed equipment good as new. Certain improved fixed equipment can be replaced. For instance, the slightly upgraded cockpit equipment on SLDF Royal Mechs can still be replaced with customized equipment.
